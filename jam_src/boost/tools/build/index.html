      <p>Boost.Build is currently in preliminary form.&nbsp; Some features are
      missing or incomplete. Instructions for accomplishing basic tasks (this
      page) are rudimentary.&nbsp; But enough functionality is working well to
      make providing Boost.Build worthwhile.&nbsp; The important bits-and-pieces
      are all there - what is left to do is some of the relatively minor glue to
      make the system smooth and easy to use.</p>
      <p>Don't expect building a full Boost object library for any random
      compiler to work yet.&nbsp; If there isn't a jam configuration file for
      your favorite compiler, consider contributing one. Secondary tasks like
      copying libraries to installation specific directories are also weak.</p>
      <p>Do expect building object libraries for some of the individual Boost
      libraries like Python and Regex Libraries to show lots of signs of life.</p>
      <p>Note that the underlying Jam build engine is mature software, and has
      been widely used for many years.&nbsp; The FTJam and Boost specific
      extensions are well on their way to being stable, and have begun to attract interest and use
      outside of Boost.</td>

<ul>
  <li>Set any environmental variables required to run your compiler and related
    tools from the command line. (It might be a good idea to verify your command line compiler is working if
    you don't use it regularly.) If you don't want to clutter your environment,
    see <a href="#Moretools">More on using the tools</a> for alternatives.</li>

<p>Using your operating system's command line interpreter, execute the following
steps.&nbsp; The sample commands given will work for both UNIX and Windows.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change to the Boost root directory.&nbsp; (The directory you unpacked the
    distribution into.&nbsp; Among others, it contain the file c++boost.gif,
    subdirectories boost, libs, more, etc.)</li>

<h2><a name="Moretools">More on using the tools</a></h2>
<p>The build system's toolsets are designed to work in either of two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The user sets up all of the environment for each toolset he wants to use,
    in the normal way. For example, for Microsoft VC++, ...vc98/bin is in the
    path, vcvars32.bat or equivalent has been invoked, etc. For Metrowerks
    CodeWarrior, cwenv.bat or equivalent has been called and ...Other Metrowerks
    Tools/Command Line Tools is in the path.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The user doesn't want his environment cluttered with this junk and wants
    to avoid the many other things done by the vendor's script files. Instead,
    he or she sets variables which point to the toolset installation directories
    (possibly in the Jamrules, or a user-setup.jam file invoked by the Jamrules).
    These variables are used by the build system to locate the tools and invoke
    the necessary setup. They are described in the comments in each toolset's
    .jam file.</li>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, the library is assumed to be the one shipped with
the compiler.</p>
<p>Additional tools can be supplied by adding an appropriate xxxx-tools.jam file
to the tools/build subdirectory, where xxxx is the name of the tool being
added.&nbsp; If you write an additional toolset file, please submit it to Boost
so others may benefit from your work.</p>
