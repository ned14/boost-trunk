<h1>Filesystem Library Update for TR2 (Preliminary)</h1>


<p>This paper proposes that the&nbsp;filesystem library component of <i>C++ Standard 
Library Technical Report 2</i> be based on Version 3 of the Boost Filesystem 
Library (see <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/filesystem">
www.boost.org/libs/filesystem</a>). Preliminary wording is provided. A
<a href="#TODO">TODO</a> list identifies remaining work to be done.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1975.html">
J16/06-0045 = WG21/N1975</a>, Filesystem Library Proposal for TR2 (Revision 3), 
was adopted by the committee in April, 2006, at the Berlin meeting. Shortly 
afterward the Library Working Group set aside work on TR2 to concentrate on 
C++0x. In the meantime, work on the Boost version of the Filesystem Library has 
continued, and Version 3 of the library has been released. Changes include:</p>


  <ul>
    <li>A single class <code>path</code> handles all aspects of 
    internationalization, replacing the previous template and its <code>path</code> 
    and <code>wpath</code> instantiations. Character types <code>char</code>,
    <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>char16_t</code>, and <code>char32_t</code> are 
    supported. This is a major simplification of the path abstraction, 
    particularly for functions that take path arguments. This change was based 
    on a suggestion by Peter Dimov.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Several operational functions have been added, including much better 
    symlink support, the ability to resize a file, and the ability to generate a 
    unique path.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Support for error reporting via <code>error_code</code> is now uniform 
    throughout the operations functions.|<br>
&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Several functions have been renamed, based on feedback from users.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>Motivation and Scope</h2>


<p>The motivation and scope for a filesystem library were described in <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1975.html">
N1975</a>, and are not repeated here. A minor scope reduction is that an 
addition to the current C++ runtime library is no longer needed.</p>


<p>Boost Filesystem Version 3  introduced a single path type that interoperates well with both <code>
basic_string</code> and user defined string types. Thus the following Design 
alternatives paragraph is no long applicable:</p>


  <blockquote>


<p><strike><i>Single path type which can at runtime accept narrow or wide character 
pathnames.</i> Although certainly interesting, and possibly superior, such a 
design would not interoperate well with the current Standard Library's 
compile-time typed <code>basic_string</code>. A new runtime polymorphic string 
class would be the best place to experiment with this concept, not a path class.</strike></p>


  </blockquote>


  <h2><a name="TODO">TODO</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply C++0X features. Boost.Filesystem needs to implement these to verify their 
    application is correct.</li>
    <li>Boost.Filesystem needs to implement <code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code> support to verify the 
    specification for these is correct.</li>
    <li>Class <code>file_status</code> is overdesigned. It holds just a single <code>file_type</code> variable, and that's unlikely to change 
  because of performance considerations. It would be simpler to eliminate class <code>
  file_status</code>, and just use <code>file_type</code> in its stead. Perhaps 
    rename to <code>file_status</code>. This hasn't been done in the Boost 
    because it would break existing code, albeit noisily.</li>
    <li>Replace path inserter and extractor <i>Effects</i> with prose, since the 
    current wording relies on 
  <code>boost::io::quoted</code></span>.</li>
    <li>Replace uses of <code>boost::iterator_facade</code>.</li>
    <li><code><a href="#Source">Source</a></code> is not specified as actually 
    implemented. Expose <code>path_traits</code>?</li>
    <li><i>Effects</i> for <code>copy</code> and <code>copy_directory</code> 
    need to be reviewed, revised, tested.</li>
    <li>Review changes to header &lt;fstream&gt;</li>
  </ul>
