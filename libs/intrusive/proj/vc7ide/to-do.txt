Add resize() to list
Implement incremental hashing
Add invariants to slist and test them after every operation
Create a generic hook that will work with all containers
Take advantage of store_hash in lookups: Instead of comparing objects, just
   compare hashes. This will improve equality for expensive objects.

Improve the use of cache_begin to unordered containers:
-> Speed up rehash
