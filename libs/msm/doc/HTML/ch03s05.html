This back-end contains the library
                    engine and defines the performance and functionality trade-offs. The currently
                    available back-end implements most of the functionality defined by the UML 2.0
                    standard at very high runtime speed, in exchange for longer compile-time. The
                    runtime speed is due to a constant-time double-dispatch and self-adapting
                    capabilities allowing the framework to adapt itself to the features used by a
                    given concrete state machine. All unneeded features either disable themselves or
                    can be manually disabled. See section 5.1 for a complete description of the
                    run-to-completion algorithm.</p><div class="sect2" title="Creation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3484"></a>Creation </h3></div></div></div><p>MSM being divided between front and back-end, one needs to first define a
                        front-end. Then, to create a real state machine, the back-end must be
                        declared:
                        </p><pre class="programlisting">typedef msm::back::state_machine&lt;my_front_end&gt; my_fsm;</pre><p>We now have a fully functional state machine type. The next sections will
                        describe what can be done with it.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Starting a state machine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3493"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="backend-start"></a></strong></span>Starting a state machine</h3></div></div></div><p>The <code class="code">start</code> method starts the state machine, meaning it will
                        activate the initial state, which means in turn that the initial state's
                        entry behavior will be called. We need the start method because you do not
                        always want the entry behavior of the initial state to be called immediately
                        but only when your state machine is ready to process events. A good example
                        of this is when you use a state machine to write an algorithm and each loop
                        back to the initial state is an algorithm call. Each call to start will make
                        the algorithm run once. The <a class="link" href="examples/iPodSearch.cpp" target="_top">iPodSearch</a> example uses this possibility.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Event dispatching"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3505"></a>Event dispatching</h3></div></div></div><p>The main reason to exist for a state machine is to dispatch events. For
                        MSM, events are objects of a given event type. The object itself can contain
                        data, but the event type is what decides of the transition to be taken. For
                        MSM, if some_event is a given type (a simple struct for example) and e1 and
                        e2 concrete instances of some_event, e1 and e2 are equivalent, from a
                        transition perspective. Of course, e1 and e2 can have different values and
                        you can use them inside actions. Events are dispatched as const reference,
                        so actions cannot modify events for obvious side-effect reasons. To dispatch
                        an event of type some_event, you can simply create one on the fly or
                        instantiate if before processing: </p><pre class="programlisting">my_fsm fsm; fsm.process_event(some_event());
some_event e1; fsm.process_event(e1)</pre><p>Creating an event on the fly will be optimized by the compiler so the
                        performance will not degrade.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Active state(s)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3514"></a>Active state(s)</h3></div></div></div><p>The backend also offers a way to know which state is active, though you
                        will normally only need this for debugging purposes. If what you need simply
                        is doing something with the active state, <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch02s02.html#UML-internal-transition">internal transitions</a></strong></span> or
                            <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch03s05.html#backend-visitor">visitors</a></strong></span> are a better
                        alternative. If you need to know what state is active, const int*
                        current_state() will return an array of state ids. Please refer to the
                            <span class="command"><strong><a class="command" href="ch06s03.html#internals-state-id">internals section</a></strong></span> to
                        know how state ids are generated.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Base state type"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3528"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="backend-base-state"></a></strong></span>Base state type </h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes, one needs to customize states to avoid repetition and provide a
                        common functionality, for example in the form of a virtual method. You might
                        also want to make your states polymorphic so that you can call typeid on
                        them for logging or debugging. It is also useful if you need a visitor, like
                        the next section will show. You will notice that all front-ends offer the
                        possibility of adding a base type. Note that all states and state machines
                        must have the same base state, so this could reduce reuse. For example,
                        using the basic front end, you need to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Add the non-default base state in your msm::front::state&lt;&gt;
                                    definition, as first template argument (except for
                                    interrupt_states for which it is the second argument, the first
                                    one being the event ending the interrupt), for example,
                                    my_base_state being your new base state for all states in a
                                    given state machine:
                                    </p><pre class="programlisting">struct Empty : public msm::front::state&lt;my_base_state&gt;</pre><p>
                                    Now, my_base_state is your new base state. If it has a virtual
                                    function, your states become polymorphic. MSM also provides a
                                    default polymorphic base type,
                                        <code class="code">msm::front::polymorphic_state</code>
                                </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add the user-defined base state in the state machine frontend
                                    definition, as a second template argument, for example:

                        from current_state()) using <code class="code">const base_state* get_state_by_id(int id)
                            const</code> where base_state is the one you just defined. You can now
                        do something polymorphically.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Visitor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3554"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="backend-visitor"></a></strong></span>Visitor</h3></div></div></div><p>In some cases, having a pointer-to-base of the currently active states is
                        not enough. You might want to call non-virtually a method of the currently
                        active states. It will not be said that MSM forces the virtual keyword down
                        your throat!</p><p>To achieve this goal, MSM provides its own variation of a visitor pattern
                        using the previously described user-defined state technique. If you add to
                        your user-defined base state an <code class="code">accept_sig</code> typedef giving the
                        return value (unused for the moment) and parameters and provide an accept
                        method with this signature, calling visit_current_states will cause accept
                        to be called on the currently active states. Typically, you will also want
                        to provide an empty default accept in your base state in order in order not
                        to force all your states to implement accept. For example your base state
                        could be:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct my_visitable_state
{
   // signature of the accept function
   typedef args&lt;void&gt; accept_sig;
   // we also want polymorphic states
   virtual ~my_visitable_state() {}
   // default implementation for states who do not need to be visited
   void accept() const {}
};</pre><p>This makes your states polymorphic and visitable. In this case, accept is
                        made const and takes no argument. It could also be:</p><pre class="programlisting">struct SomeVisitor {&#8230;};
struct my_visitable_state
{
    // signature of the accept function
    typedef args&lt;void,SomeVisitor&amp;&gt; accept_sig;
    // we also want polymorphic states
    virtual ~my_visitable_state() {}
    // default implementation for states who do not need to be visited
    void accept(SomeVisitor&amp;) const {}
};</pre><p>And now, <code class="code">accept</code> will take one argument (it could also be
                        non-const). By default, <code class="code">accept</code> takes up to 2 arguments. To get
                        more, set #define BOOST_MSM_VISITOR_ARG_SIZE to another value before
                        including state_machine.hpp. For example:</p><pre class="programlisting">#define BOOST_MSM_VISITOR_ARG_SIZE 3
#include &lt;boost/msm/back/state_machine.hpp&gt;</pre><p>Note that accept will be called on ALL active states <span class="underline">and also automatically on sub-states of a
                            submachine</span>.</p><p><span class="underline">Important warning</span>: The method
                        visit_current_states takes its parameter by value, so if the signature of
                        the accept function is to contain a parameter passed by reference, pass this
                        parameter with a boost:ref/cref to avoid undesired copies or slicing. So,
                        for example, in the above case, call:</p><pre class="programlisting">SomeVisitor vis; sm.visit_current_states(boost::ref(vis));</pre><p>This <a class="link" href="examples/SM-2Arg.cpp" target="_top">example</a> uses a

                        themselves on the functions: </p><pre class="programlisting">template &lt;class Flag&gt; bool is_flag_active()
template &lt;class Flag,class BinaryOp&gt; bool is_flag_active()</pre><p>These functions return true if the currently active state(s) support the
                        Flag property. The first variant ORs the result if there are several
                        orthogonal regions, the second one expects OR or AND, for example:</p><pre class="programlisting">my_fsm.is_flag_active&lt;MyFlag&gt;()
my_fsm.is_flag_active&lt;MyFlag,my_fsm_type::Flag_OR&gt;()</pre><p>Please refer to the front-ends sections for usage examples.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting a state"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3610"></a>Getting a state</h3></div></div></div><p>It is sometimes necessary to have the client code get access to the

                        around as long as the state machine does so why not use it? You simply just
                        need sometimes to get information about any state, even inactive ones. An
                        example is if you want to write a coverage tool and know how many times a
                        state was visited. To get a state, use the get_state method giving the state
                        name, for example: </p><pre class="programlisting">player::Stopped* tempstate = p.get_state&lt;player::Stopped*&gt;();</pre><p> or </p><pre class="programlisting">player::Stopped&amp; tempstate2 = p.get_state&lt;player::Stopped&amp;&gt;();</pre><p>depending on your personal taste. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="State machine constructor with arguments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3623"></a> State machine constructor with arguments </h3></div></div></div><p>You might want to define a state machine with a non-default constructor.

{ 
    player_(int some_value){&#8230;} 
}; </pre><p>This is possible, using the back-end as forwarding object: </p><pre class="programlisting">typedef msm::back::state_machine&lt;player_ &gt; player; player p(3);</pre><p>The back-end will call the corresponding front-end constructor upon

                        This can become a problem with older compilers and big state machines,

                        be satisfied by a performance roughly the same as most state machine
                        libraries. MSM offers a back-end policy to help there. But before you try
                        it, if you are using a VC compiler, deactivate the /Gm compiler option
                        (default for debug builds). This option can cause builds to be 3 times
