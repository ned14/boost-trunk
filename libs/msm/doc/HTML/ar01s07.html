            between front- and back- end is also described in detail.</p><div class="sect2" title="Backend: Run To Completion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3875"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="run-to-completion"></a></strong></span>Backend: Run To Completion</h3></div></div></div><p>The back-end implements the following run-to completion algorithm:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Check if one region of the concrete state machine is in a terminate or
                            interrupt state. If yes, event processing is disabled while the
                            condition perdures (forever for a terminate pseudo-state, while active
                            for an interrupt pseudo-state).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the message queue feature is enabled and if the state machine is
                            already processing an event, push the currently processed event into the
                            queue and end processing. Otherwise, notice that the state machine is
                            now processing an event and continue.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the state machine detected that no deferred event is used, skip
                            this step. Otherwise, mark the first deferred event from the deferred
                            queue as active.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Now start the core of event dispatching. If exception handling is
                            activated, this will happen inside a try/catch block and the front-end
                                <code class="code">exception_caught</code> is called if an exception occurs.
                        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The event is now dispatched in turn to every region, in the order
                            defined by the initial state front-end definition. This will, for every
                            region, call the corresponding front-end transition definition (the
                            "row" or "Row" of the transition table).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Without transition conflict, if for a given region a transition is
                            possible, the guard condition is checked. If it returns
                                <code class="code">true</code>, the transition processing continues and the
                            current state's exit action is called, followed by the transition action
                            and the new active state's entry action.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>With transition conflicts (several possible transitions, disambiguated
                            by mutually exclusive guard conditions), the guard conditions are tried
                            in reverse order of their transition definition in the transition table.
                            The first one returning <code class="code">true</code> selects its transition. Note
                            that this is not defined by the UML standard, which simply specifies
                            that if the guard conditions are not mutually exclusive, the state
                            machine is ill-formed and the behaviour undefined. Relying on this
                            implementation-specific behaviour will make it harder for the developer
                            to support another state machine framework.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If at least one region processes the event, this event is seen as
                            having been accepted. If not, the library calls
                                <code class="code">no_transition</code> on the state machine for every contained
                            region.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the currently active state is a submachine, the behaviour is
                            slightly different. The UML standard specifies that internal transitions
                            have to be tried first, so the event is first dispatched to the
                            submachine. Only if the submachine does not accept the event are other
                            (non internal) transitions tried.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>This back-end supports simple states' and submachines' internal
                            transitions. These are provided in the state's
                                <code class="code">internal_transition_table</code> type. Transitions defined in
                            this table are added at the end of the main state machine's transition
                            table, but with a lesser priority than the submachine's transitions
                            (defined in <code class="code">transition_table</code>). This means, for simple
                            states, that these transitions have higher priority than non-internal
                            transitions, conform to the UML standard which gives higher priority to
                            deeper-level transitions. For submachines, this is a non-standard
                            addition which can help make event processing faster by giving a chance
                            to bypass subregion processing. With standard UML, one would need to add
                            a subregion only to process these internal transitions, which would be
                            slower.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>After the dispatching itself, the deferred event marked in step 3 (if
                            any) now gets a chance of processing.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Then, events queued in the message queue also get a dispatching
                            chance</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Finally, compound events (transitions without a named event), if to be
                            found in the transition table, also get their dispatching chance.</p></li></ul></div><p>This algorithm illustrates how the back-end configures itself at compile-time as
                much as possible. Every feature not found in a given state machine definition is
                deactivated and has therefore no runtime cost. Compound events, deferred events,
                terminate states, dispatching to several regions, internal transitions are all
                deactivated if not used. Only for exception handling and message queue is user
                configuration necessary.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Frontend / Backend interface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e3941"></a>Frontend / Backend interface</h3></div></div></div><p>The design of MSM tries to make front-ends and back-ends (later) to be as
                interchangeable as possible. Of course, Of course, no back-end will ever implement
                every feature defined by any possible front-end and inversely, but the goal is to
                make it as easy as possible to extend the current state of the library.</p><p>To achieve this, MSM divides the functionality between both sides: the front-end
                is a sort of user interface and is descriptive, the back-end implements the state
                machine engine.</p><p>MSM being based on a transition table, a concrete state machine (or a given
                front-end) must provide a transition_table. This transition table must be made of
                rows. And each row must tell what kind of transition it is and implement the calls
                to the actions and guards. A state machine must also define its regions (marked by
                initial states) And that is about the only constraints for front-ends. How the rows
                are described is implementer's choice. </p><p>Every row must provide:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>A <code class="code">Source</code> typedef indicating, well, the type of the source

                state machine, unless for debugging purposes, like the pstate function does in the

                how to automatically display typeid-generated names, but these are not very readable
                on all platforms, so it can help to know how the ids are generated. The ids are
                generated using the transition table, from the &#8220;Start&#8221; column up to down, then from
                the &#8220;Next&#8221; column, up to down, as shown in the next image: </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/AnnexA.jpg"></span></p><p>Stopped will get id 0, Open id 1, ErrorMode id 6 and SleepMode (seen only in the

                transition-less initial states or states created using the explicit_creation
                typedef, these will be added as a source at the end of the transition table. If you
                have submachine states, a row will be added for them at the end of the table, after
                the automatically or explicitly created states, which can change their id. The next
                help you will need for debugging would be to call the current_state method of the
                state_machine class, then the display_type helper to generate a readable name from
                the id. If you do not want to go through the transition table to fill an array of
                names, the library provides another helper, fill_state_names, which, given an array
                of sufficient size (please see next section to know how many states are defined in
                the state machine), will fill it with typeid-generated names. </p></div><div class="sect2" title="Metaprogramming tools"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e4130"></a>Metaprogramming tools</h3></div></div></div><p>We can find for the transition table more uses than what we have seen so far.
                Let's suppose you need to write a coverage tool. A state machine would be perfect
                for such a job, if only it could provide some information about its structure. It is
                especially relevant if you are working with Executable UML, which bases most of its
                dynamic behaviour on state machines.As a matter of fact, thanks to the transition
                table and Boost.MPL, it does.</p><p>What is needed for a coverage tool? You need to know how many states are defined
                in the state machine, and how many events can be fired. This way you can log the
                fired events and the states visited in the life of a concrete machine and be able to
                perform some coverage analysis, like &#8220;fired 65% of all possible events and visited
                80% of the states defined in the state machine&#8221;. To achieve this, MSM provides a few
                useful tools:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>generate_state_set&lt;transition table&gt;: returns a mpl::set of all the
