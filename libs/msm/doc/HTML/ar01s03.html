They describe the
                different stages of the lifeline, the events influencing it, and what it does when a
                particular event is detected at a particular stage. They offer the complete
                specification of the dynamic behavior of the thing.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Concepts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e206"></a>Concepts</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" title="State machine, state, transition, event"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e209"></a>State machine, state, transition, event </h4></div></div></div><p>Thinking in terms of state machines is a bit surprising at first, so let us
                    have a quick glance at the concepts.</p><p>A state machine is a concrete model describing the behavior of a system. It is
                    composed of a finite number of states and transitions.</p><p>
                    <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/sm.gif"></span></p><p>A simple state has no sub states. It can have data, entry and exit behaviors
                    and deferrable events. One can add entry and exit conditions to states (or state
                    machines), which are executed whenever a state is entered or left, no matter
                    how. A state can also have internal transitions which cause no entry or exit
                    action to be called. A state can mark events as deferred. This means the event
                    cannot be processed if this state is active, but it must be retained. Next time
                    a state not deferring this event is active, the event will be processed, as if
                    it had just been detected. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/state.gif"></span></p><p>A transition is the switching between active states, triggered by an event.
                    Actions and guard conditions can be attached to the transition. The action is
                    executes when the transition fires, the guard is a Boolean operation executed
                    first and which can prevent the transition from firing if returning
                    false.</p><p>
                    <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/transition.jpg"></span></p><p>An initial state marks the first active state of a state machine. It has no
                    real existence and neither has the transition originating from it.</p><p>
                    <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/init_state.gif"></span></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Submachines, orthogonal regions, pseudostates"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e241"></a>Submachines, orthogonal regions, pseudostates </h4></div></div></div><p>A composite state is a state containing a region or decomposed in two or more
                    regions. A composite state contains its own set of states and regions. </p><p>A submachine is a state machine inserted as a state in another state machine.
                    The same state machine can be inserted more than once. </p><p>Orthogonal regions are parts of a composite state or submachine, each having
                    its own set of mutually exclusive set of states and transitions. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/regions.gif"></span></p><p>UML also defines a number of pseudo states, which are considered important
                    concepts to model, but not enough to make them first-class citizens. The
                    terminate pseudo state terminates the execution of a state machine (MSM handles
                    this slightly differently. The state machine is not destroyed but no further
                    event processing occurs.). </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/terminate.gif"></span></p><p>An exit point pseudo state exits a composite state or a submachine and forces
                    termination of execution in all contained regions.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/exit.gif"></span></p><p>An entry point pseudo state allows a kind of controlled entry inside a
                    composite. Precisely, it connects a transition outside the composite to a
                    transition inside the composite. An important point is that this mechanism only
                    allows a single region to be entered. In the above diagram, in region1, the
                    initial state would become active. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/entry_point.gif"></span></p><p>There are also two more ways to enter a composite state (apart the obvious and
                    more common case of a transition terminating on the composite as shown in the
                    region case). An explicit entry means that an inside state is the target of a
                    transition. Unlike with direct entry, no tentative encapsulation is made, and
                    only one transition is executed. Needless to say, I would not recommend using
                    this. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/explicit.gif"></span></p><p>The last entry possibility is using fork. A fork is an explicit entry into one
                    or more regions. Other regions are again activated using their initial state. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/fork.gif"></span></p></div><div class="sect3" title="History"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e284"></a>
                    <span class="command"><strong><a name="uml-history"></a></strong></span>History </h4></div></div></div><p>UML defines two sorts of history, shallow history and deep history. Shallow
                    history is a pseudo state representing the most recent substate of a composite
                    or submachine. A composite can have at most one shallow history. A transition
                    with a history pseudo state as target is equivalent to a transition with the
                    most recent substate as target. And very importantly, only one transition may
                    originate from the history. Deep history is a shallow history recursively
                    reactivating the substates of the most recent substate. It is represented like
                    the shallow history with a star (H* inside a circle).</p><p>
                    <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/history.gif"></span></p><p>History is not a completely satisfying concept. First of all, there can be
                    just one history pseudo state and only one transition may originate from it. So
                    they do not mix well with orthogonal regions as only one region can be
                    &#8220;remembered&#8221;. Deep history is even worse and looks like a last-minute addition.
                    History has to be activated by a transition and only one transition originates
                    from it, so how to model the transition originating from the deep history pseudo
                    state and pointing to the most recent substate of the substate? As a bonus, it
                    is also inflexible and does not accept new types of histories. Let's face it,
                    history sounds great and is useful in theory, but the UML version is not quite
                    making the cut. And therefore, MSM provides a different version of it. </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Completion events / anonymous transitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e298"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="uml-anonymous"></a></strong></span>Completion events / anonymous
                    transitions</h4></div></div></div><p>Completion events, also called anonymous transitions, are defined as
                    transitions having no defined event triggering them. This means that such
                    transitions will immediately fire when a state being the source of an anonymous
                    transition becomes active, provided that a guard allows it. They are useful in
                    modeling algorithms as an activity diagram would normally do. In the real-time
                    world, they have the advantage of being able to estimate how long a periodically
                    executed action will last. For example, consider the following diagram. </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/completion.gif"></span></p><p>The designer now knows at any time that he will need a maximum of 4
                    transitions. Being able to estimate how long a transition takes, he can estimate
                    how much of a time frame he will need to require (real-time applications are
                    often executed at regular intervals). If he can also estimate the duration of
                    actions, he can even use graph algorithms to better estimate his timing
                    requirements. </p></div><div class="sect3" title="Internal transitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e310"></a><span class="command"><strong><a name="UML-internal-transition"></a></strong></span> Internal transitions </h4></div></div></div><p>Internal transitions are transitions executing in the scope of the active
                    state, being a simple state or a submachine. One can see them as a
                    self-transition of this state, without an entry or exit action called.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Conflicting transitions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e316"></a>
                    <span class="command"><strong><a name="transition-conflict"></a></strong></span>Conflicting transitions </h4></div></div></div><p>If, for a given event, several transitions are enabled, they are said to be in
                    conflict. There are two kinds of conflicts: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>For a given source state, several transitions are defined,
                                triggered by the same event. Normally, the guard condition in each
                                transition defines which one is fired.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The source state is a submachine or simple state and the conflict
                                is between a transition internal to this state and a transition
                                triggered by the same event and having as target another
                                state.</p></li></ul></div><p>The first one is simple; one only needs to define two or more
                    rows in the transition table, with the same source and trigger, with a different
                    guard condition. Beware, however, that the UML standard wants these conditions
                    to be not overlapping. If they do, the standard says nothing except that this is
                    incorrect, so the implementer is free to implement it the way he sees fit. In
                    the case of MSM, the transition appearing last in the transition table gets
                    selected first, if it returns false (meaning disabled), the library tries with
                    the previous one, and so on.</p><p>
                    <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/conflict1.gif"></span></p><p>In the second case, UML defines that the most inner transition gets selected
                    first, which makes sense, otherwise no exit point pseudo state would be possible
                    (the inner transition brings us to the exit point, from where the containing
                    state machine can take over). </p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="../images/conflict2.gif"></span></p><p>Msm handles all these cases itself, so the designer needs only concentrate on
                    its state machine and the UML subtleties (not overlapping conditions), not on
                    implementing this behavior himself. </p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="State machine glossary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e344"></a>State machine glossary</h3></div></div></div><p>
