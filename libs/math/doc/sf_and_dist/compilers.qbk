[section:compilers Compilers]

This section contains some information about how various compilers work with this library.
It is not comprehensive and updated experiences are always welcome.
Some effort has been made to suppress unhelpful warnings but it is difficult to achieve this on all systems.

The code has been compiled and tested with:
[table Compiler Notes
[[Compiler][Platform][Notes]]
[[Intel 9.1, 8.1][Win32 and Linux][The tests cases tend to generate a lot of
      warnings relating to numeric underflow of the test data: these are 
      harmless.  The headers all appear to be warning free.]]
[[g++ ][Linux and HP-UX][The test suite doesn't compile with -pedantic 
      (a problem with system headers included by Boost.Test not compiling 
      with that option), otherwise our headers should be warning free.]]
[[HP aCC][HP-UX][ Unfortunately this emits quite a few warnings from libraries 
      upon which we depend (TR1, Array etc).]]
[[Borland 5.8.2][Windows][Almost works: some effort has been put into porting to this compiler.
      However, during testing a number of instances were encountered where this compiler
      generated incorrect code: completely omitting a function call seemingly at random.
      For this reason, [*we cannot recommend using this library with this compiler], as the
      correct operation of the code cannot be guaranteed.]]
[[MSVC 8.0][Windows][Warning free at level 4]]
