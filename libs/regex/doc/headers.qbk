[section:headers Headers]

There are two main headers used by this library: `<boost/regex.hpp>` 
provides full access to the main template library, while `<boost/cregex.hpp>` 
provides access to the (deprecated) high level class RegEx, and the 
POSIX API functions.

There is also a header containing only forward declarations 
`<boost/regex_fwd.hpp>` for use when an interface is dependent upon 
[basic_regex], but otherwise does not need the full definitions.
