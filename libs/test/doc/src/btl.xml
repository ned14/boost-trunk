   The Boost Test Library provides a matched set of components for writing test programs, organizing tests in to 
   simple test cases and test suites, and controlling their runtime execution. The Program Execution Monitor is also 
   useful in some production (non-test) environments.

   <title>About this documentation</title>

   <para role="first-line-indented">
    This documentation is <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> intended to be read though from the beginning to the end by 
    a novice user. You can do that if you are interested in detailed bottom-up description of all Boost.Test components.
    Otherwise you are better off jumping directly to the subject of your interest. For example, if you are interested in 
    unit testing framework you may go directly <link linkend="utf">there</link>, but for novice users I recommend to 
    start from simple <link linkend="utf.tutorials">tutorials</link>. Looking for quick help - check 
    <link linkend="btl.faq">FAQ</link> section for resolution to many popular issues you may be faced with. Most pages 
    should link you directly to the terms that you need to understand it. For help with compilation see compilation 
    sections of an appropriate component.

   <title>Portability</title>
   
   <para role="first-line-indented">
    Because the Boost Test Library is critical for porting and testing Boost libraries, it has been written to be 
    conservative in its use of C++ features, and to keep dependencies to a bare minimum.

   <para role="first-line-indented">
    Boost.Test supports all main Boost compilers and platforms. Confirmation of its status on core and additional 
    platforms/compilers can be seen by viewing Boost.Test's own internal regression test results on
