  <title>Introduction</title>

   <para role="first-line-indented">
    The components of a C++ program may report user-detected errors in several ways, such as via a return value or 
    throwing an exception. System-detected errors such as dereferencing an invalid pointer are reported in other ways, 
    totally operating system and compiler dependent.
   </para>
   
   <para role="first-line-indented">
    Yet many C++ programs, both production and test, must run in an environment where uniform reporting of errors is 
    necessary. For example, converting otherwise uncaught exceptions to non-zero program return codes allows many 
    command line, script, or batch environments to continue processing in a controlled manner. Even some 
    <acronym>GUI</acronym> environments benefit from the unification of errors into program return codes.
   </para>

   <para role="first-line-indented">
    <firstterm>The Boost Test Library's &pem;</firstterm> relieves users from messy error 
    detection and reporting duties by providing a replacement function main() which calls a user-supplied cpp_main() 
    function within a monitored environment. The supplied main() then uniformly detects and reports the occurrence of 
    several types of errors, reducing them to a uniform return code which is returned to the host environment.
   </para>
   
   <para role="first-line-indented">
    Uniform error reporting is particularly useful for programs running unattended under control of scripts or batch 
    files. Some operating systems pop up message boxes if an uncaught exception occurs, and this requires manual 
    intervention. By converting such exceptions into non-zero program return codes, the library makes the program a 
    better citizen. More uniform reporting of errors isn't a benefit to some programs, particularly programs always 
    run by hand of a knowledgeable person. So the &pem; wouldn't be worth using in that environment.
   </para>
 
   <para role="first-line-indented">
    Uniform error reporting can be also useful in test environments such as the Boost regression tests. Be aware though 
    in such case it might be preferable to use the <link linkend="utf">Unit Test Framework</link>, cause it allows one 
    to use the <link linkend="utf.user-guide.testing-tools">Testing tools</link> and generate more detailed error information.
   </para>

 <section id="pem.usage">
  <title>Usage</title>

  <para role="first-line-indented">
   To facilitate uniform error reporting the &pem; supplies function main() as part if it's implementation. To use the 
   &pem; instead of regular function main your program is required to supply a function cpp_main() with same signature.
  </para>
   
  <para role="first-line-indented">
   Here is the traditional Hello World program implemented using the &pem;:

  <btl-example name="example24">
   <title>The &pem;: Hello World</title>
  </btl-example>
     
  <para role="first-line-indented">
   It really is that simple - just change the name of your initial function from main() to cpp_main(). Do make sure 
   the argc and argv parameters are specified (although you don't have to name them if you don't use them).
  </para>
  
  <para role="first-line-indented">
   The &pem; treats as errors:

   So what if some function had thrown a runtime_error with the message "big trouble" and it's not trapped by any 
   catch clause? Like in a following example:

  <btl-example name="example25">
   <title>The &pem;: standard exception detection</title>

  <para role="first-line-indented">
   Note that in both examples above we used single-header variant of the &pem;. Alternatively we can build and link with
   standalone library. In case of static library we are not required to include any &pem; related headers. To use dynamic 
   library you are required to include 
   <ulink url="../../../../boost/test/prg_exec_monitor.hpp"><filename>boost/test/prg_exec_monitor.hpp</filename></ulink>
   and define <xref linkend="pem.flag.dyn-link" endterm="pem.flag.dyn-link"/> during program compilation. The same 
   header is required if you want to employ <link linkend="pem.compilation.auto-linking">auto-linking</link> feature.

   The &pem; reports errors to both cout (details) and cerr (summary). Primary detailed error 
   messages appear on standard output stream so that it is properly interlaced with other output, thus aiding error 
   analysis. While the final error notification message appears on standard error stream. This increases the 
   visibility of error notification if standard output and error streams are directed to different devices or files.

    If you opted to link your program with the standalone library, you need to build it first. To build a standalone

    listed as source files in your makefile<footnote><simpara>There are varieties of make systems that can be used. To name

    bjam  tool. Make  systems require some kind of configuration file that lists all files that constitute the library 
    and all build  options. For example the makefile that is used by make, or the Microsoft Visual Studio project file,
