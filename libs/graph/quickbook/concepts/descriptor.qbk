[section Descriptor]
The Descriptor concept describes requirements common to vertex and edge descriptors of
all graph types.

[heading Refinement Of]
[StdRegular] and [SgiLessThanComparable].

[heading Associated Types]
There are no associated types of a Descriptor.

[heading Valid Expressions]
Beyond the requirements of the refined concepts, the descriptor does not require any
additional valid expressions.

[heading Notes]
Note that because both model the [SgiLessThanComparable] concept, they can be used as
keys in any associative container modeling the [SgiAssociativeContainer] concept
(e.g., `std::map`, `std::set`, etc).
