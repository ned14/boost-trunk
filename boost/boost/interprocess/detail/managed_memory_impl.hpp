   achieve this, this class uses the reserved space provided by the allocation
   algorithm to place a named_allocator_algo, who takes care of name mappings.

      Destroying an object:

      If the destructor throws, the memory will be freed and that exception
      will be thrown.

      destructors are called. If any of these throws, the exceptions are
      ignored. The name association will be erased, memory will be freed and
