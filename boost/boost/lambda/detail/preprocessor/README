The preprocessor library is not part of BOOST, but LL does use it.
Hence, the library is under lambda subdirectory.
This subdirectory will be removed if preprocessor becomes an official boost
library.

Note! The switch.hpp is the only LL file that uses preprocessor.
The implementation requires almost similar template definitions for
varying number of case statements.
With preprocessor, a single definition is enough, and all 
the template definitions are generated.

Having said this, it's likely that I'll rewrite switch.hpp so that it does not
use the preprocessor library, rather than expand the use of preprocessor lib
to other similar parts of LL. 
The preprocessor lib is really neat, but if error messages were bad prior 
preprocessor, now they are _bad_.
Also, the code is really hard to read, as there's a nested recursive
looping going on (take a look at switch.hpp).

So the purpose of this readme is to say, don't rely on this 
directory being here for eternity.
