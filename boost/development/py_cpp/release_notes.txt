    Lots of documentation updates

    added 4-argument template constructor to py::Tuple

    added "add" member function to ClassWrapper<> to allow arbitrary Python
    objects to be added to an extension class.

    gen_all.py now generates support for n argument member functions and n+1
    argument member functions at the suggestion of "Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve"
    <rwgk@cci.lbl.gov>

    Added regression tests and re-ordered declare_base calls to verify that the
    phantom base class issue is resolved.

    Integrated Ullrich Koethe's brilliant from_python_experiment for better
    error-reporting in many cases.

    extclass.h, gen_extclass.py:
        removed special-case MSVC code
        added much commentary
        removed unused py_copy_to_new_value_holder

    init_function.h, gen_init_function.py:
        added missing 'template' keyword on type-dependent template member usage
        removed special-case MSVC code
        added much commentary

    Removed the need for the phantom base class that screwed up inheritance
    hierarchies, introduced error-prone ordering dependencies, and complexified
    logic in many places!
    
    extclass.h: Added some explanatory comments, removed wasteful m_self member
    of HeldInstance

    extclass_demo.cpp: Added #pragmas which allow compilation in ansi strict
    mode under Metrowerks

    functions.h: Added virtual_function as part of phantom base class removal;
    expanded commentary

    pyptr.h: Added some missing 'typename's and a GCC workaround fix

    subclass.cpp: Added missing string literal const_cast<>s.

    Fix friend function instantiation bug caught by Metrowerks (thanks
    Metrowerks!)

    Add proof-of-concept for one technique of wrapping function that return a
    pointer

    Worked around MSVC optimizer bug by writing to_python(double) and
    to_python(float) out-of-line

    Add /Zm200 option to vc6_prj to deal with MSVC resource limitations
    
    Remove conflicting /Ot option from vc6_prj release build

    Added a fix for interactions between default virtual function
    implementations and declare_base(). You still need to write your
    declare_base() /after/ all member functions have been def()d for the two
    classes concerned.  Many, many thanks to Ullrich Koethe
    <koethe@informatik.uni-hamburg.de> for all his work on this.

    Added missing conversions:
        to_python(float)
        from_python(const char* const&)
        from_python(const double&)
        from_python(const float&)

    Added a Regression test for a reference-counting bug thanks to Mark Evans
    (<mark.evans@clarisay.com>)

    const-ify ClassBase::getattr()

    Add repr() function to Class<T>

    Add to_python/from_python conversions for PyPtr<T>

    Standardize set_item/get_item interfaces (instead of proxies) for Dict and List

    Add Reprable<> template to newtypes.h

    Fix a bug wherein the __module__ attribute would be lost for classes that have a
    default virtual function implementation.

    Remove extra ';' in module.cpp thanks to "Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve"
    <rwgk@cci.lbl.gov>

    Fix a bug in the code of example1.html
