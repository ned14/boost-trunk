    <p>
       Py_cpp is a system for quickly and easily interfacing C++ code with <a
      href="http:www.python.org">Python</a> such that the Python interface is
      very similar to the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally
      intrusive on your C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter
      your C++ classes in any way in order to use them with py_cpp. The system
      <em>should</em> simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
      Python.
    <p>
       The source code for py_cpp, including a MSVC demo project is available <a
      href="py_cpp_20001031.zip">here</a>. It has been tested against Python
      1.5.2 with GCC 2.95.2 and Microsoft Visual C++ 6 sp4 using both the <a
      href="http://www.stlport.org"> STLport</a> standard library implementation
      <em>and</em> the library implementation which ships with the compiler. It
      has also been tested against Python 2.0c1 with MSVC++ 6sp4 by Alex
      Martelli. It will work with the next release of Metrowerks CodeWarrior
      Pro6 (the first release has a bug that's fatal to py_cpp_).  Py_cpp
      requires the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> libraries, and is
      currently under formal review on <a href=
      "http://www.egroups.com/list/boost">the boost mailing list</a> for
      acceptance into boost.
    <p>
       py_cpp was originally written by David Abrahams. Ullrich Koethe supplied
      an early version of the overloading support and wrote the support for
      implicit conversions of arguments that have a C++ inheritance
      relationship. Alex Martelli supplied the first tests against Python 2.0.
      The members of the boost mailing list and the Python community supplied
      invaluable early feedback. The development of py_cpp wouldn't have been
      possible without the generous support of Dragon Systems/Lernout and
      Hauspie, Inc.

      functions (e.g. <code>__getattr__(self, name)</code>), are given in

    <h3>
       Naming Contest
    </h3>
    <p>
       Yes, I know py_cpp is a lousy name. Problem is, the best names my puny
      imagination can muster (IDLE and GRAIL) are taken, so I'm holding a
      naming contest. First prize? You get to pick the name&lt;0.2wink&gt; and
      you will be credited in the documentation. Names that have been suggested
      so far include:
