Kevlin Henney (<a href="mailto:kevlin@curbralan.com">mailto:kevlin@curbralan.com</a>, <a href="http://www.curbralan.com">http://www.curbralan.com</a>)
is an independent consultant and trainer based in the UK. He has developed and
delivered training course material and consultancy on many aspects of OO
development, which he has practiced across a number of domains for over a
decade. His professional interests include patterns, OO and component based
design, architecture, distributed object systems, C++, and Java. He is also a
member of the BSI C++ standards committee.
</p>

<p>Now that writing code is no longer the core responsibility of his job, his
non-professional interests seem to include the hacking associated with the
aforementioned professional interests. However, never being one to keep
something to himself (like C++'s relationship with C, this is regarded as both a
strength and a weakness), he shares/inflicts (delete as necessary) his
professional and non-professional development experiences with/on (ditto) others
through writing articles and presenting tutorials, workshops and papers at
conferences.</p>
<p>He is married, and not just to his work. He and Carolyn have neither children
nor pets, but he feels that the missing aggravation is made up for by a house
that needs a great deal of work, requiring constant attention and feeding of
money. The little spare time that remains to him is taken up with music,
reading, pub appreciation, etc. Finally, although he enjoys writing, Kevlin is
not really one for writing in the third person.</p>
