Marcus is a computer scientist in the Advanced Technology Group at Adobe 
Systems, Inc. He has been developing software since 1985. In the summer of 2000, 
during a camping trip on the Washington coast, he read Czarnecki and 
Eisenecker's seminal &quot;Generative Programming&quot; book. This opened up a whole new 
world of development possibilities for him. His first contribution to Boost 
followed soon afterwards; he discovered a way to exploit the properties of the 
sizeof operator to simulate partial specialization (is_pointer, etc. with Jesse 
Jones). </p>
<p>A mathematician by training, Mat is amused by abstraction. In his spare 
professional time he is studying algebraic specification, category theory, 
universal algebra, and philosophy in the hopes of someday understanding and 
exploiting the answer to the question &quot;What is type?&quot;. He is currently active as 
Adobe's representative on the ANSI/ISO C++ committee. </p>
<p>Mat lives with his wife and young son in Seattle. </p>
