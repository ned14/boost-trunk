Ed Brey lives in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, a village outside of Milwaukee. In
the summertime, he likes to play tennis with his fiancée, and in the winter, if
there is enough snow, he likes to go tobogganing or ice-skating. If it is not
nice enough outside for either of those, he plays on the piano. Although Ed
enjoys doing those activities, most of his time is currently spent at work and
at home studying. He works at <a href="http://www.eaton.com">Eaton Corporation</a>
in Milwaukee and is working on his masters degree in computer engineering
through <a href="http://www.ntu.edu">NTU</a>.
<p>Ed started working for Eaton as part of <a href="http://www.mu.edu">Marquette
University</a>'s engineering co-op program. Upon graduation in 1995 from
Marquette with a BS in electrical and computer engineering, he was hired on
full-time at Eaton. At Eaton, Ed has been primarily focused on embedded system
design and programming in the industrial controls industry. Recently, however,
he has delved into writing a near-real-time database engine running under
Windows.
<p>Ed has held programming as a pastime since his grade school days, when he
wrote a babysitting invoicing program. Soon after, he wrote a game inspired by
the TV game show &quot;Press Your Luck&quot;. Ever since, programming languages
and concepts, along with finding ways to improve the art and science of coding
software, have always peeked his interest.
<p>Lastly, Ed has managed to retain his perspective. As fun as computers and
programming are, Ed's true love in his life is his wife Beth.</p>
