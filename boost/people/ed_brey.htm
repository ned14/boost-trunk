  Milwaukee. In the summertime, he likes to play tennis with his wife, and in
  the winter, if there is enough snow, he likes to go tobogganing or
  ice-skating. If it is not nice enough outside for either of those, he plays
  on the piano.</p>

  <p>Ed works at <a href="http://www.eaton.com">Eaton Corporation</a> in
  Milwaukee. He started working there as part of <a href=
  "http://www.mu.edu">Marquette University</a>'s engineering co-op program.
  Upon graduation in 1995 from Marquette with a BS in electrical and computer
  engineering, he was hired on full-time, where he initially worked on
  firmware for industrial controls. More recently, he has been working on a
  PC-based configuration tool for industrial networks. Ed received his MS in
  computer engineering in 2001 from <a href="http://www.ntu.edu">NTU</a>
  .</p>

  <p>Ed has held programming as a pastime since his grade school days, when
  he wrote a babysitting invoicing program. Soon after, he wrote a game
  inspired by the TV game show &ldquo;Press Your Luck&rdquo;. Ever since,
  programming languages and concepts, along with finding ways to improve the
  art and science of coding software, have always peeked his interest.</p>

  <p>Lastly, Ed has managed to retain his perspective. As fun as computers
  and programming are, Ed's true loves in life are the Lord Jesus whom he
  serves and his dear wife Beth.</p>
