Ed Brey lives in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, a village outside of
Milwaukee.  In the summertime, he likes to play tennis with his fiancée, and
in the winter, if there is enough snow, he likes to go tobogganing or
ice-skating.  If it is not nice enough outside for either of those, he plays
on the piano.  Although Ed enjoys doing those activities, most of his time is
currently spent at work and at home studying.  He works at <A
HREF="http://www.eaton.com">Eaton Corporation</A> in Milwaukee and is working
on his masters degree in computer engineering through <A
HREF="http://www.ntu.edu">NTU</A>.

<P>Ed started working for Eaton as part of <A
HREF="http://www.mu.edu">Marquette University</A>'s engineering co-op program.
Upon graduation in 1995 from Marquette with a BS in electrical and computer
engineering, he was hired on full-time at Eaton.  At Eaton, Ed has been
primarily focused on embedded system design and programming in the industrial
controls industry.  Recently, however, he has delved into writing a
near-real-time database engine running under Windows.

<P>Ed has held programming as a pastime since his grade school days, when he
wrote a babysitting invoicing program.  Soon after, he wrote a game inspired
by the TV game show "Press Your Luck".  Ever since, programming languages and
concepts, along with finding ways to improve the art and science of coding
software, have always peeked his interest.

<P>Lastly, Ed has managed to retain his perspective.  As fun as computers and
programming are, Ed's true love in his life is his fiancée Beth.</P>
