  life programming in one language or another. From assembly, through BASIC,
  and up to C++ and Lisp, he has managed to program on a variety of computers
  and operating systems.</p>

  <p>Currently he is running Redshift Software, Inc. (<a href=
  "http://redshift-software.com">redshift-software.com</a>), a company he
  founded with the help of some friends in 1997.</p>

  <p>In the past he managed to get a concurrent MS and BS in Computer Science
  from Loyola University at Chicago. Work for the Institute for the Learning
  Sciences at Northwestern University building AI related systems. And worked
  on game development at Jellyvision Inc. (<a href=
  "http://jellyvision.com">jellyvision.com</a>). Where he lead the
  programming of "You Don't Know Jack: The 5th Dementia", and of "That's a
  Fact: Jack! Read.". Which where the basis for the development of the first
  two versions of "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire".</p>

  <p>His motto of "clean code, clean graphics, it can always stand
  improvement" has repeatedly gotten him in trouble.</p>
