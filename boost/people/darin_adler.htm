  been programming computers since 1976. He loves to do it.</p>

  <p>His first major professional experience was at <a href=
  "http://apple.com">Apple Computer</a>. In 1988 he led the team that rewrote
  the Macintosh Finder in C++. Before that project was completed, he was
  shanghaied to be the technical lead for the System 7 project (these days
  they would call it "Mac OS 7"). The group he formed to help him do that,
  the Blue Meanies, is still a <a href=
  "http://www.cupertino.de/pages/archiv/EasterEggs/BlueMeanies.html">legend</a>
  in the Apple community.</p>

  <p>Since Apple, Darin has worked at <a href=
  "http://www.generalmagic.com">General Magic</a> as an architect of the
  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Magic+Cap">Magic Cap</a> OS, used
  the moniker <a href="http://bentspoon.com">Bent Spoon Software</a> to do
  consulting, and helped start Eazel, a company that worked to make Linux
  easier to use and developed the Nautilus graphical shell for <a href=
  "http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>. Since 1997, he has worked from his home
  in Los Angeles, CA, collaborating with clients and coworkers in other
  locations.</p>

  <p>He prefers to use and program Macintosh computers with C++. But work on
  the GNOME project is best accomplished with a non-Macintosh PC. (That's why
  Darin is sitting in front of <a href=
  "http://boost.sourceforge.net/photos/darin_adler.jpg">two computers</a>.)
  The other people working on the GNOME project don't like C++, so he's
  writing a lot of C code these days.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://boost.sourceforge.net/photos/darin_adler.jpg">larger
  version</a> of his picture shows him hard at work with his C++ guru, his
  daughter Sophia.</p>

  <p>He has hobbies and stuff but you don't want to read about that here.</p>
