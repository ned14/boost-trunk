<p>Dateline: Sept 14, 2006.  This inaugural Boost conference promises
to be the main face-to-face venue for all things Boost, from using
libraries to writing them, from evangelizing Boost to deployment
within your organization, from infrastructure and process to vision
and mission, and from TR1 to TR2. Given the range and interests of
the participants, the event is going to be intense and in-depth.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" id="tracks" name="tracks">Tracks</a></h1>
<p>Recognizing the breadth of the community, we are offering two
primary tracks: the first three days will be focused mostly on the
practical interests of Boost and TR1 end-users, and the last three
will be directed more towards hard-core Boost developers, with one
overlap day at midweek.  Thus, the conference fosters interaction
both within <em>and</em> across these tracks, with an emphasis on service
to our user base.</p>
<p>Sessions will run in the morning and evening, leaving a midday
break of several hours so that attendees can get out and enjoy the
town and its surroundings, or just to have time to work together in
small, informal groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" id="sessions" name="sessions">Sessions</a></h1>
<p>In the spirit of Boost, many sessions will be participatory and/or
collaborative in nature.  The program committee is drafting a call
for sessions that you can expect to see in the next few weeks.  In
the meantime, please raise any questions about—or ideas for—the
conference on the <a class="reference" href="http://www.boost.org/more/mailing_lists.htm">Boost mailing lists</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7" id="venue" name="venue">Venue</a></h1>
<p>The main venue for this conference will be the <a class="reference" href="http://www.aspenphys.org">Aspen Center for
Physics</a> in Aspen, Colorado.  The town of Aspen is known for its
world-class cuisine and its envigorating, natural setting.  As
generations of scientists can attest, the Center's beautiful
location and its low-key atmosphere create a unique and lively
environment for thought, education, and collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8" id="hotel" name="hotel">Hotel</a></h1>
<p>The main conference hotel will be the <a class="reference" href="http://aspenmeadowsresort.dolce.com/">Aspen Meadows Resort</a>.
Located within walking distance of the Physics Center, the Meadows
provides 90 rooms, a restaurant, and overflow conference facilities
should the event expand.</p>

<div class="section">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" id="conference-size" name="conference-size">Conference Size</a></h1>
<p>Much more than having a great number of attendees, it's important
that this first BoostCon be a success, so we're starting small.
Registration will initially be limited to just 100 places, except
that we'll accomodate 200 participants on Wednesday, when the two
main tracks overlap.  Contingency plans are in place that <em>may</em> allow
us to expand registration should demand prove overwhelming, but
when registration opens we recommend securing your place early, in
case that isn't possible.</p>
