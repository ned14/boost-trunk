<h1>Boost Discussion Policy</h1>
<p>Email discussion is the tie that binds boost members together into a community.
If the discussion is stimulating and effective, the community thrives.&nbsp; If
the discussion degenerates into name calling and ill will, the community withers
and dies.</p>
<h2>Acceptable topics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Queries to determine interest in a possible library submission.</li>
  <li>Technical discussions about a proposed or existing library, including bug
    reports and requests for help.</li>
  <li>Formal Reviews of proposed libraries.</li>
  <li>Reports of user experiences with Boost libraries.</li>
  <li>Boost administration or policies.</li>
  <li>Compiler specific workarounds as applied to Boost libraries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other topics related to boost development may be acceptable, at the discretion of moderators. If unsure, go ahead and post. The moderators
will let you know.</p>
<h2>Unacceptable topics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Advertisements for commercial products.</li>
  <li>Requests for help getting non-boost code to compile with your compiler.
    Try the comp.lang.c++.moderated newsgroup instead.</li>
  <li>Requests for help interpreting the C++ standard.&nbsp; Try the comp.std.c++
    newsgroup instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prohibited behavior</h2>
<p>Prohibited behavior will not be tolerated.&nbsp; The moderators will ban
postings by abusers.</p>
<h3>Flame wars</h3>
<p>Personal insults, argument for the sake of argument, and all the other
behaviors which fall into the &quot;flame war&quot; category are
prohibited.&nbsp; Discussions should focus on technical arguments, not the
personality traits or motives of participants.</p>
<h3>Third-party attacks</h3>
<p>Attacks on third parties such as software vendors, hardware vendors, or any
other organizations, are prohibited.&nbsp; Boost exists to unite and serve the
entire C++ community, not to disparage the work of others.</p>
<p>Does this mean that we ban the occasional complaint or wry remark about a
troublesome compiler?&nbsp; No, but be wary of overdoing it.</p>
<h3>Off-topic posts</h3>
<p>Discussions which stray from the acceptable topics are strongly discouraged.
While off-topic posts are often well meaning and not as individually corrosive
as other abuses, cumulatively the distraction damages the effectiveness of
discussion.</p>
<h2>Culture</h2>
<p>In addition to technical skills, Boost members value collaboration,
acknowledgement of the help of others, and a certain level of politeness.&nbsp; Boost
membership is very international, and ranges widely in age and other
characteristics. Think of discussion as occurring among colleagues in a widely read forum, rather
than among a few close friends.</p>
<h2>Guidelines for effective discussions</h2>
<p>Apply social engineering to prevent heated technical discussion from
degenerating into a shouting match.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Questions help.&nbsp; If someone suggests something that you don't think
    will work, then replying with a question like &quot;will that compile?&quot;
    or &quot;won't that fail to compile, or am I missing something?&quot; is a
    lot smoother than &quot;That's really stupid - it won't compile.&quot;&nbsp;
    Saying &quot;that fails to compile for me, and seems to violate section
    n.n.n of the standard&quot; would be yet another way to be firm without
    being abrasive.</li>
  <li>If most of the discussion has been code-free generalities, posting a bit
    of sample code can focus people on the practical issues.</li>
  <li>If most of the discussion has been in terms of specific code, try to talk
    a bit about hidden assumptions and generalities that may be preventing
    discussion closure.</li>
  <li>Taking a time-out is often effective.&nbsp; Just say: &quot;Let me think
    about that for a day or two.&nbsp; Let's take a time-out to digest the
    discussion so far.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid Parkinson's Bicycle Shed.&nbsp; Parkinson described a committee formed
to oversee design of an early nuclear power plant.&nbsp; There were three agenda
items - when to have tea, where to put the bicycle shed, and how to
ensure nuclear safety.&nbsp; Tea was was disposed of quickly as trivial.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Nuclear safety was discussed for only
an hour - it was so complex, scary, and technical that even
among experts few felt comfortable with the issues.&nbsp; Endless days were then
spent discussing where to put the bicycle shed (the parking lot would
be a modern equivalent) because everyone
understood the issues and felt comfortable discussing them.&nbsp;</p>
