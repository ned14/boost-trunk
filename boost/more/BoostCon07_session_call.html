    <h1>Boost Conference 2007: 
    Call for  Proposals</h1>
    <p>The first annual Boost conference will take place in Aspen, Colorado, May 
    14-18, 2007.</p>
    <p>This inaugural Boost conference promises to be the main face-to-face 
    venue for all things Boost, from using libraries to writing them, from 
    evangelizing Boost to deployment within your organization, from 
    infrastructure and process to vision and mission, and from TR1 to TR2. Given 
    the range and interests of the participants, the event is going to be 
    intense and in-depth.</p>
    <p>BoostCon 2007 is looking for session presenters. We invite you to propose a session. </p>
    <p>More <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/BoostCon07.html">
    BoostCon 2007 information</a> is available on the Boost web site.</p>

    <h2>Session <a name="formats">formats</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Presentations</strong> focus on a practitioner’s ideas and 
    experience with anything relevant to Boost and Boost users. </p>
    <p><strong>Panels</strong> feature three or four people presenting their 
    ideas and experiences relating to Boost relevant, controversial, emerging, 
    or unresolved issues. Panels may be conducted in several ways, such as 
    comparative, analytic, or historic. </p>
    <p><strong>Tutorials</strong> are formally prepared sessions at which 
    instructors teach conference participants specific Boost relevant skills.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Workshops</strong> provide an active arena for advancements in 
    Boost relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced 
    practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest and 
    experience. </p>
    <p><strong>Other formats</strong> may also be of interest. Don't hold back a 
    proposal just because it doesn't fit into a pigeonhole. </p>
    <h2>Session <a name="topics">topics</a></h2>
    <p>Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the following: </p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>Interactive and collaborative sessions are encouraged, as this is the 
    nature of both the online Boost community and the style of learning and 
    participation that has proven most successful at such events. Sessions can 
    be tutorial based, with an emphasis on interaction and participant 
    involvement, or workshop based, whether hands-on programming or paper-based, 
    discussion-driven collaborative work. </p>

    <p>Like Boost itself,
    BoostCon is strictly non-profit. Conference organizers and presenters 
    are not paid for their time. Any surplus money will be rolled over into the 
    succeeding year
    BoostCon budget. </p>
    <p>To reduce the price for attendees this first year, conference organizers 
    and presenters will pay the regular admission fee and will receive no 
    compensation. We recognize this is tough for presenters on tight budgets, so 
    will consider providing financial support if requested, based on budget and 
    the applicant's needs.</p>
