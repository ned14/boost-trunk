    <h1>Boost Conference 2007: 
    Call for Session Proposals</h1>
    <p>The first annual Boost conference will take place in Aspen, Colorado, May 
    14-18. This promises to be the main face-to-face event for all things Boost, 
    from generic-programming techniques to Boost community, from using Boost 
    libraries to writing Boost libraries, from deployment considerations to 
    promoting the use of Boost more widely, from TR1 to TR2. Given the range and 
    interests of the participants, this event promises to be intense and in 
    depth. We invite you to propose a session. </p>
    <p>More <a href="http://www.boost.org/more/BoostCon07.html">
    BoostCon 2007 information</a> is available on the Boost web site.</p>

    <h2>Session <a name="formats">formats</a></h2>
    <p><strong>Presentations</strong> focus on a practitioner’s ideas and 
    experience with anything relevant to Boost and Boost users. </p>
    <p><strong>Panels</strong> feature three or four people presenting their 
    ideas and experiences relating to Boost relevant, controversial, emerging, 
    or unresolved issues. Panels may be conducted in several ways, such as 
    comparative, analytic, or historic. </p>
    <p><strong>Tutorials</strong> are formally prepared sessions at which 
    instructors teach conference participants specific Boost relevant skills.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Workshops</strong> provide an active arena for advancements in 
    Boost relevant topics. Workshops provide the opportunity for experienced 
    practitioners to develop new ideas about a topic of common interest and 
    experience. </p>
    <p><strong>Other formats</strong> may also be of interest. Don't hold back a 
    proposal just because it doesn't fit in a pigeonhole. </p>
    <h2>Session <a name="topics">topics</a></h2>
    <p>Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to, the following: </p>

    participation that has proven most successful at such events. Sessions can

    involvement, or workshop based, whether hands-on programming or paper-based,

    <p>Like Boost itself,
    BoostCon is strictly non-profit. Conference organizers and presenters 
    are not paid for their time. Any surplus money will be rolled over into the 
    succeeding year
    BoostCon budget. </p>
    <p>To reduce the price for attendees this first year, conference organizers 
    and presenters will pay the regular admission fee and will receive no 
    compensation. We recognize this is tough for presenters on tight budgets, so 
    will consider providing financial support if requested, based on budget and 
    the applicant's needs.</p>
