<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Each release of Boost software is overseen by a release manager, who 
coordinates release activities via the Boost mailing list, as well as performing 
the detailed procedures for the release.</p>
<p>Boost developers assist the release manager by reviewing regression test 
logs, and committing fixes  to CVS.</p>
<h2>Release Procedure <a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discussion on the main Boost mailing list to determine the target date for 
  release candidate branch and tag of the CVS main trunk.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Release manager performs release candidate branch, and also tags the 
  branch point in main trunk.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Regression tests run on release candidate branch.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Developers fix problems, test, and commit fixes. See below for details.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Repeat previous two steps until release manager is satisfied.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Release manager rolls out the actual release.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release Procedures for <a name="Developers">Developers</a></h2>
<ul>
  <li>As the release candidate branch date approaches (as announced on the main 
  mailing list), bring the main trunk CVS files you are responsible for into a 
  stable state.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If you know of changes in either your code or its dependencies, start 
  checking regression test results to ensure your tests still pass.&nbsp; Don't 
  necessarily wait for the initial release tagging.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>After the release manager announces that the release candidate branch has 
  occurred, check the latest regression test results to be sure 
  your tests haven't broken.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Developers can continue working on main trunk code changes after 
  the release candidate branch has occurred. There is no need to wait until the release 
  itself.&nbsp; 
  Modified files committed to CVS on the main trunk will not be included in the release unless the 
  developer explicitly commits the changes to the release candidate branch.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If specific to the release candidate only, the fixes should be committed 
  directly to the release candidate branch. In the more common case of fixes 
  which apply to both the main trunk and the release branch, the fixes are best 
  made to the main trunk, and then merged into the release candidate branch. <br>
  <br>
  After a fix has been committed to the main trunk, here is a 
  typical procedure (assuming the release candidate branch is named RC_1_26_2) 
  to merge the fixed main trunk into the release candidate branch:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Command Line CVS:</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>[After fixed code is committed to main branch]
cvs tag -F -c merged_to_RC_1_28_2 buggycode.hpp [tag new merged point]
cvs update -r RC_1_26_2 [switch to the release candidate branch]
cvs update -j HEAD buggycode.hpp [merge changes from the trunk to the branch]
 --&gt; RCS file: /cvsroot/boost/.../buggycode.hpp,v
 --&gt;    retrieving revision 1.4
 --&gt;    retrieving revision 1.6
 --&gt;    Merging differences between 1.4 and 1.6 into buggycode.hpp

cvs commit -m &quot;Merged fix for problem xyz from trunk to branch&quot; buggycode.hpp

[Repeat as needed]</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>WinCVS:</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <p>After fixed code is committed to main branch, tag as the new merged 
    point:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Select file(s) if not already selected.</p>
    <p>Modify | Create tag on selection... | Create tag settings | Enter the tag 
    name to create: <code>merged_to_RC_1_26_2</code>, Overwrite existing tags 
    with same name | OK.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Switch to the release candidate branch:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Modify | Update selection... | 
    Update settings | Sticky options | Retrieve rev/tag/branch: <code>RC_1_26_2</code> | OK</p>
    </blockquote>
      <p>Merge changes from main trunk into the release candidate branch:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Modify | Update selection... | 
    Update settings | Merge options | Only this rev/tag: <code>HEAD</code> | OK</p>
    </blockquote>
      <p>Commit merge results:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Modify | Commit... | Enter log message: ... | OK</p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
