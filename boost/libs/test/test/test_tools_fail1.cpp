//    7 Nov 00  Initial boost version (Beman Dawes)

//  While it would appear that including boost/test_tools.hpp is unneeded,
//  it is useful because  BOOST_INCLUDE_MAIN is defined.
#define BOOST_INCLUDE_MAIN  // for testing, include rather than link
#include <boost/test/test_tools.hpp>

int test_main( int, char *[] )  // note the name
