    <P class="first-line-indented"><EM>In this release Most
        of Boost.Test components undergo a major or significant change in both
        design and implementation</EM>. 
  I've strived to keep an interface unchanged as much as 
  possible. The primary goals for this update were:  </P>
    <UL>
      <LI>Make a Unit Test Framework better suited for different 'runners'</LI>
      <LI>Make Unit Test Framework simpler internally by eliminating test cases 
        hierarchy</LI>
      <LI>Make test tools more uniform</LI>
      <LI>Make auto Unit Test Framework as usable as possible</LI>
    </UL>
    <P class="first-line-indented">Following are details of what updated/changed specifically in each area of 
    Boost.Test:</P>
    <OL type="I">
      <LI>
        <H3> Execution Monitor</H3>
      </LI>
    </OL>
    <P class="first-line-indented">The execution monitor design changes from inheritance to delegation. If 
        previously one needed to inherit from the boost::execution monitor to do a 
        monitored run of a function, now one need to employ an instance of the 
        boost::execution_monitor</P>

  <P class="first-line-indented">In addition following features implemented:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI>Debugger presence detected, in which case catching system errors (SEH) is 
      disabled unless explicitly enabled. For now only works for msvc family</LI>
      <LI> Automatic detection of memory leaks introduced. For now only works for 
        msvc family.
      Unit Test Framework turns this feature on by default.</LI>
    </UL>
      <OL start="2">
        <LI type="I">
          <H3>Unit Test Framework (UTF)</H3>
        </LI>
      </OL>
      <P class="first-line-indented">This component of Boost.Test undergo a most dramatic changes in both 
      design and implementation. </P>
      <UL>
        <LI> UTF doesn't employ test cases hierarchy anymore. There is single class 
          test_case that model one testing unit and class test_suite that model a 
          collection of test units. Previously UTF employed compound test cases (for 
          example parameterized test case) which went through it's components (simple 
          subtests) during testing run time. Now compound test present itself as test 
          case generator which produce a collection if test_case instances during test 
          tree construction time. One consequence of this is that user doesn't need to 
          keep track of compound test case parameters is it used be. test_case now 
          employs a polymorphic callback to a actual test function. As a result of 
          this one could supply any zero arity function as an argument of 
          BOOST_TEST_CASE. So no extra support needed to be able to create 
          boost::function or boost::bind based tests cases.   </LI>
        <LI>Introduced generic mechanism to traverse the test tree. Anyone willing 
            to do so just need to implement test_tree_visitor interface and employ 
            traverse_test_tree. This allows to implement any pre/post processing over 
            test tree.   </LI>
        <LI>Introduced a notion of framework. The framework is responsible for:
          <UL>
            <LI>initializing and providing access to master test suite</LI>
            <LI>providing access to current test case</LI>
            <LI> running testing from given test tree node (simple or compound). By default it runs from 
                 root - master test suite. Supports both sequential and random order.</LI>
            <LI>one may register any test observer agent (implements test_observer 
                 interface) and framework notifies it of all test events</LI>
            <LI>provides access to any test case based to unique test unit id</LI>
            <LI>Using the framework one could implement different test runners. UTF library 
                supplies one console runner (unit_test_main.cpp). But it's possible to do 
                one winmain based or anything else. For example GUI program that build test 
                tree and then run tests by request from any point in test tree.</LI>
          </UL>
        </LI>
        <LI>Unit test log interface changed to single line (used to be begin/end 
            macros). Unit test log formatter interface changed. How it much simpler and 
            straightforward. Two supplied implementation are separated.   </LI>
        <LI> Notion of unit test result that was responsible for result collection 
             and reporting eliminated. Instead introduced independent notions: 
             results_collector and results_reporter. Results reporting formatter 
             interface made public. Also results_reporter now allows to change an output 
             stream.</LI>
        <LI> Progress monitor functionality (which used to be activated in log 
             level log_progress) now is an independent test observer and implemented by 
             class progress_monitor.</LI>
        <LI> Test case template interface changed. Now user doesn't need to 
             explicitly register meta class.</LI>
        <LI>In addition couple more features implemented:
          <UL>
            <LI>Added support for test case timing</LI>
            <LI>UTF made __cdecl - safe</LI>
            <LI> Result report include skipped tests</LI>
            <LI> io saver facilities employed to guard against undesirable modification 
                 in output streams formatting</LI>
            <LI> template test case automatically generate name that includes type name</LI>
            <LI> --detect_memory_leak and --random command line arguments added</LI>
          </UL>
        </LI>
      </UL>
      <OL start="3">
        <LI type="I">
          <H3> Test Tools</H3>
        </LI>
      </OL>
      <UL>
        <LI> Test Tools interfaces now provide 3 version for each tool:
          <UL>
            <LI>CHECK- reports an error if assertion failed</LI>
            <LI>WARN - reports a warning if assertion failed</LI>
            <LI>REQUIRE - reports an error if assertion failed and aborts test case execution</LI>
          </UL>
        </LI>
        <LI>Implementation completely reworked. All tools implemented now through single vararg function</LI>
        <LI>In addition following modifications made:
          <UL>
            <LI>CHECK_COLLECTION interface changed: it now expect 4 arguments</LI>
            <LI>BITWISE_EQUAL renamed to CHECK_BITWISE_EQUAL; old name still provided, 
                but is deprecated</LI>
            <LI>CHECK_COLLECTION interface changed to use PP_SEQ and as a result 
                support arbitrary(actually maximum is fixed but configurable) number of 
                predicate arguments</LI>
            <LI>most of templates eliminated speeding up test modules compilation</LI>
            <LI> floating-point precision set to include all significant digits 
                 (actually the formula may require some rework since it obviously doesn't do 
                 a good job sometimes)</LI>
            <LI>BOOST_CHECK/WARN/REQUIRE_SMALL test tool added</LI>
            <LI>deprecated test tools names are removed </LI>

  <H2><A name="Migration">Boost Test migration guide</A></H2> 
  <P class="first-line-indented">This version of Boost.Test library substitute
    the original testing library used in a Boost. These are several simple steps
    you need to follow to smoothly migrate to the latest software.</P> 
  <P class="first-line-indented">If your code were using the original version
    of cpp_main facility, to migrate you will need to delete the inclusion of
    the &lt;boost/test/cpp_main.cpp&gt;, since this file is not present any more.
    After that you have following choices:</P> 
  <UL> 
    <LI>Link with Unit Test Framework (exact library name depends on compiler
      you are using, but most probably it will be libboost_prg_exec_monitor.lib). </LI>
