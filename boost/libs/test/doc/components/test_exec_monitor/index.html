  <P class="first-line-indented">How should a test program report errors? Displaying an error message 
    is an obvious possibility:</P>
  <PRE class="code"><SPAN class="reserv-word">if</SPAN>( something_bad_detected )
  std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;something bad has been detected&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;</PRE>
  <P class="first-line-indented">But that requires inspection of the program's output after each run to 
    determine if an error occurred. Since test programs are often run as part of a regression test suite, 
    human inspection of output to detect error messages is too time consuming and unreliable. Test frameworks 
    like GNU/expect can do the inspections automatically, but are overly complex for simple testing.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">A better simple way to report errors is for the test program to return 
    EXIT_SUCCESS (normally 0) if the test program completes satisfactorily, and EXIT_FAILURE if an error 
    is detected. This allows a simple regression test script to automatically and unambiguous detect success 
    or failure. Further appropriate actions such as creating an HTML table or emailing an alert can be 
    taken by the script, and can be modified as desired without having to change the actual C++ test programs.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">A testing protocol based on a policy of test programs returning EXIT_SUCCESS 
    or EXIT_FAILURE does not require any supporting tools; the C++ language and standard library are sufficient. 
    The programmer must remember, however, to catch all exceptions and convert them to program exits with 
    non-zero return codes. The programmer must also remember to not use the standard library assert() 
    macro for test code, because on some systems it results in undesirable side effects like a message 
    requiring manual intervention.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">The Boost Test Library's Test Execution Monitor combines the powers of 
    the <A href="../test_tools/index.html">Test Tools</A> and the <A href="../execution_monitor/index.html">Execution 
    Monitor</A> to automates those tasks. It provides a main() function which calls a user-supplied <SPAN class="new-term">test_main()</SPAN> 
    function. The library supplied main() relieves users from messy error detection and reporting duties. 
    Users could use the Test Tools to perform complex validation tasks.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">The Test Execution Monitor is intended for fairly simple test programs 
    or to dig a problem in an existent production code. The <A href="../prg_exec_monitor/index.html">Program 
    Execution Monitor</A> may be more suitable to monitor production (non-test) programs, cause it does 
    not affect your program performance. The <A href="../utf/index.html">Unit Test Framework</A> 
    may be, for several reasons, more suitable for complex test programs:<BR>
  <UL>
    <LI>you will be able to separate test on several test cases. The Unit test framework will produce 
      the pass/fail statistic for each test case separately</LI>
    <LI>if any of your test cases fails with exception if does not affect the rest of test</LI>
    <LI>you will be able to run specific test case by it's name</LI>
    <LI>separation onto test cases allows you clearly see which part of your test module is dedicated 
      to which part of tested functionality</LI>
    <LI>extra options for configuration</LI>
  </UL>
  <H2><A name="Usage">Usage</A></H2>
  <P class="first-line-indented"> Let's take a look on the following simple test program:</P>
  <PRE class="code">#<SPAN class="reserv-word">include</SPAN> &lt;my_class.hpp&gt;

<SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN> main( <SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN>, <SPAN class="cpp-type">char</SPAN>* [] )
{
    my_class test_object( &quot;qwerty&quot; );

    <SPAN class="reserv-word">return</SPAN> test_object.is_valid() ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE;
}
</PRE>
  <P class="first-line-indented">There are several issues with above test. 
  <OL>
    <LI>You need to convert is_valid result in proper result code.</LI>
    <LI>Would exception happened in test_object construction of method is_valid invocation, the program 
      will crash.</LI>
    <LI>You wont see any output, would you run this test manually.</LI>
  </OL>
  <P class="first-line-indented">The Test Execution Monitor solve all these issues. To integrate with 
    it above program needs to be changed to: </P>
  <PRE class="code">#<SPAN class="reserv-word">include</SPAN> &lt;my_class.hpp&gt;
#<SPAN class="reserv-word">include</SPAN> &lt;<A href="../../../../../boost/test/test_tools.hpp">boost/test/test_tools.hpp</A>&gt;

<SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN> test_main( <SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN>, <SPAN class="cpp-type">char</SPAN>* [] )  <SPAN class="comment">// note the name!</SPAN>
{
    my_class test_object( &quot;qwerty&quot; );

    BOOST_CHECK( test_object.is_valid() );

    <SPAN class="reserv-word">return</SPAN> 0;
}
</PRE>
  <P class="first-line-indented">Now, you not only receive uniform result code, even in case of exception, 
    but also nicely formatted output from BOOST_CHECK tool, would you choose to see it. Is there any other 
    ways to perform checks? The following example test program shows six different ways to detect and 
    report an error in the add() function.</P>
  <PRE class="code">#<SPAN class="reserv-word">include</SPAN> &lt;<A href="../../../../../boost/test/test_tools.hpp">boost/test/test_tools.hpp</A>&gt;

<SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN> add( <SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN> i, <SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN> j ) { <SPAN class="reserv-word">return</SPAN> i+j; }

<SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN> test_main( <SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN>, <SPAN class="cpp-type">char </SPAN>*[] )             <SPAN class="comment">// note the name!</SPAN>
{
    // six ways to detect and report the same error:
    BOOST_CHECK( add( <SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN>,<SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN> ) == <SPAN class="literal">4</SPAN> );        <SPAN class="comment">// #1 continues on error</SPAN>
    BOOST_REQUIRE( add( <SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN>,<SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN> ) == <SPAN class="literal">4</SPAN> );      <SPAN class="comment">// #2 throws on error</SPAN>
    <SPAN class="reserv-word">if</SPAN>( add( <SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN>,<SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN> ) != <SPAN class="literal">4</SPAN> )
      BOOST_ERROR( <SPAN class="literal">&quot;Ouch...&quot;</SPAN> );            <SPAN class="comment">// #3 continues on error</SPAN>
    <SPAN class="reserv-word">if</SPAN>( add( <SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN>,<SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN> ) != <SPAN class="literal">4</SPAN> )
      BOOST_FAIL( <SPAN class="literal">&quot;Ouch...&quot;</SPAN> );             <SPAN class="comment">// #4 throws on error</SPAN>
    <SPAN class="reserv-word">if</SPAN>( add( <SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN>,<SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN> ) != <SPAN class="literal">4</SPAN> ) throw <SPAN class="literal">&quot;Oops...&quot;</SPAN>; <SPAN class="comment">// #5 throws on error</SPAN>

    <SPAN class="reserv-word">return</SPAN> add( <SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN>, <SPAN class="literal">2</SPAN> ) == <SPAN class="literal">4</SPAN> ? <SPAN class="literal">0</SPAN> : <SPAN class="literal">1</SPAN>;       <SPAN class="comment">// #6 returns error code</SPAN>
}</PRE>
  <P><B>Approach #1</B> uses the BOOST_CHECK tool, which displays an error message on std::cout that includes 
    the expression that failed, the source file name, and the source file line number. It also increments 
    an error count. At program termination, the error count will be displayed automatically by the Test 
    Execution Monitor.</P>
  <P><B>Approach #2</B> using the BOOST_REQUIRE tool, is similar to #1, except that after displaying the 
    error, an exception is thrown, to be caught by the Test Execution Monitor. This approach is suitable 
    when writing a explicit test program, and the error would be so severe as to make further testing 
    impractical. BOOST_REQUIRE differs from the C++ Standard Library's assert() macro in that it is always 
    generated, and channels error detection into the uniform Test Execution Monitor reporting procedure.</P>
  <P><B>Approaches #3 and #4</B> are similar to #1 and #2 respectively, except that the error detection 
    is coded separately. This is most useful when the specific condition being tested is not indicative 
    of the reason for failure.</P>
  <P><B>Approach #5</B> throws an exception, which will be caught and reported by the Test Execution Monitor. 
    This approach is suitable for both production and test code, in libraries or not. The error message 
    displayed when the exception is caught will be most meaningful if the exception is derived from std::exception, 
    or is a char* or std::string.</P>
  <P><B>Approach #6</B> uses a return value to inform the caller of the error. This approach is particularly 
    suitable for integrating existing test code with the test tools library. Although it works fine with 
    the Program Execution Monitor or the Test Execution Monitor libraries, and is very useful for running 
    existing code under them, most C++ experts prefer using exceptions for error reporting. </P>

  <P class="first-line-indented"> The Test Execution Monitor implements a special case of the framework 
    usage. Accordingly it shares most of the implementation with the <A href="../utf/index.html">Unit
