  <H1 class="subtitle">The Execution Monitor compilation</H1>

  <P class="first_line_indented">To compile the Execution Monitor as standalone library compose it using 
    only <A href="../../../src/execution_monitor.cpp">execution_monitor.cpp</A> as a source file. You 
    could add this file also directly to the list of source files for your project. Boost Test Library's 
    components include this file as a part of their compilation procedure. In some cases you may want 
    to include the source file along with header file into your sources. But be aware that to be able 
    to catch all kinds of standard exceptions and to implement signal handling logic this file will bring 
    a lot of dependencies. You may use this component in both debug and release modes. But be aware that 
    in release mode the Execution Monitor wouldn't catch Microsoft C runtime debug events.</P>
