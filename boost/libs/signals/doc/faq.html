<h2>Q: Don't noncopyable signal semantics mean that a class with a signal member will be noncopyable as well?</h2>
<p> No. The compiler will not be able to generate a copy
      constructor or copy assignment operator for your class if it has
      a signal as a member, but you are free to write your own copy
      constructor and/or copy assignment operator. Just don't try to
      copy the signal.</p>

<h2>Q: Is Boost.Signals thread-safe?</h2>
<p> No. Using Boost.Signals in a multithreaded concept is very
      dangerous, and it is very likely that the results will be less
      than satisfying. Boost.Signals will support thread safety in the
      future.</p>
