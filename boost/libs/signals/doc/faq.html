<h2>Q: Don't noncopyable signal semantics mean that a class with a signal member will be noncopyable as well?</h2>
<p> No. The compiler will not be able to generate a copy
      constructor or copy assignment operator for your class if it has
      a signal as a member, but you are free to write your own copy
      constructor and/or copy assignment operator. Just don't try to
      copy the signal.</p>

<h2>Q: Is Boost.Signals thread-safe?</h2>
<p> No. Using Boost.Signals in a multithreaded concept is very
      dangerous, and it is very likely that the results will be less
      than satisfying. Boost.Signals will support thread safety in the
      future.</p>

<h2>Q: How do I get Boost.Signals to work with Qt?</h2>
<p> When building with Qt, the Moc keywords <code>signals</code> and
      <code>slots</code> are defined using preprocessor macros,
      causing programs using Boost.Signals and Qt together to fail to
      compile. Although this is a problem with Qt and not
      Boost.Signals, a user can use the two systems together by
      defining the <code>BOOST_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE</code> macro to some other
      identifier (e.g., <code>signalslib</code>) when building and
      using the Boost.Signals library. Then the namespace of the
      Boost.Signals library will be
      <code>boost::BOOST_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE</code> instead of
      <code>boost::signals</code>. To retain the original namespace
      name in translation units that do not interact with Qt, you can
      use a namespace alias:</p>
<pre>
  namespace boost {
    namespace signals = BOOST_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE;
  }
</pre>

    <p> Redefining <code>BOOST_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE</code> breaks link
      compatibility with modules compiled using different
      <code>BOOST_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE</code> identifiers. <p>
