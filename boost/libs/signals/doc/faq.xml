      <question>
        <para>Don't noncopyable signal semantics mean that a class
        with a signal member will be noncopyable as well?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>No. The compiler will not be able to generate a copy
        constructor or copy assignment operator for your class if it
        has a signal as a member, but you are free to write your own
        copy constructor and/or copy assignment operator. Just don't
        try to copy the signal.</para>

      <question>
        <para>Is Boost.Signals thread-safe?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>No. Using Boost.Signals in a multithreaded concept is
        very dangerous, and it is very likely that the results will be
        less than satisfying. Boost.Signals will support thread safety
        in the future.</para>

      <question>
        <para>How do I get Boost.Signals to work with Qt?</para>
      </question>
      <answer>
        <para>When building with Qt, the Moc keywords
        <code>signals</code> and <code>slots</code> are defined using
        preprocessor macros, causing programs using Boost.Signals and
        Qt together to fail to compile. Although this is a problem
        with Qt and not Boost.Signals, a user can use the two systems
        together with a little extra effort. There are two ways to do
        this:</para>

        <para>The first way involves defining
        the <code>BOOST_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE</code> 
        macro to some other identifier (e.g., <code>signalslib</code>)
        when building and using the Boost.Signals library. Then the
        namespace of the Boost.Signals library will be
        <code>boost::BOOST_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE</code> instead of
        <code>boost::signals</code>. To retain the original namespace
        name in translation units that do not interact with Qt, you
        can use a namespace alias:</para>

        <programlisting>
  namespace boost {
    namespace signals = BOOST_SIGNALS_NAMESPACE;
  }
</programlisting>

        <para>The second way, provided by Frank Hess, involves
        creating a header <code>signalslib.hpp</code> that contains
          the following code:</para>

        <programlisting>#ifdef signals
#error "signalslib.hpp must be included before any qt header"
#endif

#include &lt;boost/signal.hpp&gt;
namespace boost
{
  namespace signalslib = signals;
}</programlisting>

        <para>This header must be included before any Qt headers. Once
        it has been included, you can refer to the Signals library via
        the namespace <code>boost::signalslib</code>. This option is
        preferable to the first option because it can be used without
        recompiling the Signals library binary. </para>
