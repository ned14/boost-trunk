      <P>The POSIX-Extended regular expression syntax is supported by the POSIX C 
         regular expression API's, and variations are used by the utilities <EM>egrep</EM>
         and <EM>awk</EM>. You can construct POSIX extended regular expressions in 
         Boost.Regex by passing the flag <EM>extended</EM> to the regex constructor, for 
         example:</P>
      <PRE>// e1 is a case sensitive POSIX-Extended expression:
boost::regex e1(my_expression, boost::regex::extended);
// e2 a case insensitive POSIX-Extended expression:
boost::regex e2(my_expression, boost::regex::extended|boost::regex::icase);</PRE>
      <H3>POSIX Extended Syntax<A name="extended"></A></H3>
      <P>In POSIX-Extended regular expressions, all characters match themselves except 
         for the following special characters:</P>
      <PRE>.[{()\*+?|^$</PRE>
      <H4>Wildcard:</H4>
      <P>The single character '.' when used outside of a character set will match any 
         single character except:</P>
      <P>The NULL character when the flag <EM>match_no_dot_null</EM> is passed to the 
         matching algorithms.</P>
      <P>The newline character when the flag <EM>match_not_dot_newline</EM> is passed to 
         the matching algorithms.</P>
      <H4>Anchors:</H4>
      <P>A '^' character shall match the start of a line when used as the first 
         character of an expression, or the first character of a sub-expression.</P>
      <P>A '$' character shall match the end of a line when used as the last character 
         of an expression, or the last character of a sub-expression.</P>
      <H4>Marked sub-expressions:</H4>
      <P>A section beginning ( and ending ) acts as a marked sub-expression.&nbsp; 
         Whatever matched the sub-expression is split out in a separate field by the 
         matching algorithms.&nbsp; Marked sub-expressions can also repeated, or 
         referred to by a back-reference.</P>
      <H4>Repeats:</H4>
      <P>Any atom (a single character, a marked sub-expression, or a character class) 
         can be repeated with the *, +, ?, and {}&nbsp;operators.</P>
      <P>The * operator will match the preceding atom zero or more times, for example 
         the expression a*b will match any of the following:</P>
      <PRE>b
ab
aaaaaaaab</PRE>
      <P>The + operator will match the preceding atom one or more times, for example the 
         expression a+b will match any of the following:</P>
      <PRE>ab
aaaaaaaab</PRE>
      <P>But will not match:</P>
      <PRE>b</PRE>
      <P>The ? operator will match the preceding atom zero or&nbsp;one times, for 
         example the expression ca?b will match any of the following:</P>
      <PRE>cb
cab</PRE>
      <P>But will not match:</P>
      <PRE>caab</PRE>
      <P>An atom can also be repeated with a bounded repeat:</P>
      <P>a{n}&nbsp; Matches 'a' repeated exactly <EM>n</EM> times.</P>
      <P>a{n,}&nbsp; Matches 'a' repeated <EM>n</EM> or more times.</P>
      <P>a{n, m}&nbsp; Matches 'a' repeated between <EM>n</EM> and <EM>m</EM> times 
         inclusive.</P>
      <P>For example:</P>
      <PRE>^a{2,3}$</PRE>
      <P>Will match either of:</P>
      <PRE>aa
aaa</PRE>
      <P>But neither of:</P>
      <PRE>a
aaaa</PRE>
      <P>It is an error to use a repeat operator, if the preceding construct can not be 
         repeated, for example:</P>
      <PRE>a(*)</PRE>
      <P>Will raise an error, as there is nothing for the * operator to be applied to.</P>
      <H4>Back references:</H4>
      <P>An escape character followed by a digit <EM>n</EM>, where <EM>n </EM>is in the 
         range 1-9, matches the same string that was matched by sub-expression <EM>n</EM>.&nbsp; 
         For example the expression:</P>
      <PRE>^(a*).*\1$</PRE>
      <P>Will match the string:</P>
      <PRE>aaabbaaa</PRE>
      <P>But not the string:</P>
      <PRE>aaabba</PRE>
      <P><EM><STRONG>Caution</STRONG>: the POSIX standard does not support back-references 
            for "extended" regular expressions, this is a compatible extension to that 
            standard.</EM></P>
      <H4>Alternation</H4>
      <P>The | operator will match either of its arguments, so for example: abc|def will 
         match either "abc" or "def".&nbsp;
      </P>
      <P>Parenthesis can be used to group alternations, for example: ab(d|ef) will match 
         either of "abd" or "abef".</P>
      <H4>Character sets:</H4>
      <P>A character set is a bracket-expression starting with [ and ending with ], it 
         defines a set of characters, and matches any single character that is a member 
         of that set.</P>
      <P>A bracket expression may contain any combination of the following:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
         <H5>Single characters:</H5>
         <P>For example [abc], will match any of the characters 'a', 'b', or 'c'.</P>
         <H5>Character ranges:</H5>
         <P>For example [a-c] will match any single character in the range 'a' to 
            'c'.&nbsp; By default, for POSIX-Extended regular expressions, a character <EM>x</EM>
            is within the range <EM>y</EM> to <EM>z</EM>, if it collates within that 
            range;&nbsp;<EM><STRONG>this results in locale specific behavior</STRONG></EM> .&nbsp; 
            This behavior can be turned off by unsetting the <EM><A href="syntax_option_type.html#extended">
                  collate</A></EM> option flag - in which case whether a character appears 
            within a range is determined by comparing the code points of the characters 
            only.</P>
         <H5>Negation:</H5>
         <P>If the bracket-expression begins with the ^ character, then it matches the 
            complement of the characters it contains, for example [^a-c] matches any 
            character that is not in the range a-c.</P>
         <H5>Character classes:</H5>
         <P>An expression of the form [[:name:]] matches the named character class "name", 
            for example [[:lower:]] matches any lower case character.&nbsp; See <A href="character_class_names.html">
               character class names</A>.</P>
         <H5>Collating Elements:</H5>
         <P>An expression of the form [[.col.] matches the collating element <EM>col</EM>.&nbsp; 
            A collating element is any single character, or any sequence of characters that 
            collates as a single unit.&nbsp; Collating elements may also be used as the end 
            point of a range, for example: [[.ae.]-c] matches the character sequence "ae", 
            plus any single character in the range "ae"-c, assuming that "ae" is treated as 
            a single collating element in the current locale.</P>
         <P>Collating elements may be used in place of escapes (which are not normally 
            allowed inside character sets), for example [[.^.]abc] would match either one 
            of the characters 'abc^'.</P>
         <P>As an extension, a collating element may also be specified via its <A href="collating_names.html">
               symbolic name</A>, for example:</P>
         <P>[[.NUL.]]</P>
         <P>matches a NUL character.</P>
         <H5>Equivalence classes:</H5>
         <P>
            An expression oftheform[[=col=]], matches any character or collating element 
            whose primary sort key is the same as that for collating element <EM>col</EM>, 
            as with colating elements the name <EM>col</EM> may be a <A href="collating_names.html">
               symbolic name</A>.&nbsp; A primary sort key is one that ignores case, 
            accentation, or locale-specific tailorings; so for example [[=a=]] matches any 
            of the characters: a, à, á, â, ã, ä, å, A, À, Á, Â, Ã, Ä and Å.&nbsp; 
            Unfortunately implementation of this is reliant on the platform's collation and 
            localisation support; this feature can not be relied upon to work portably 
            across all platforms, or even all locales on one platform.</P>
      </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H5>Combinations:</H5>
      <P>All of the above can be combined in one character set declaration, for example: 
         [[:digit:]a-c[.NUL.]].</P>
      <H4>Escapes</H4>
      <P>The POSIX standard defines no escape sequences for POSIX-Extended regular 
         expressions, except that:</P>
      <UL>
         <LI>
         Any special character preceded by an escape shall match itself.
         <LI>
         The effect of any ordinary character being preceded by an escape is undefined.
         <LI>
            An escape inside a character class declaration shall match itself: in other 
            words the escape character is not "special" inside a character class 
            declaration; so [\^] will match either a literal '\' or a '^'.</LI></UL>
      <P>However, that's rather restrictive, so the following standard-compatible 
         extensions are also supported by Boost.Regex:</P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
         <H5>Escapes matching a specific character</H5>
         <P>The following escape sequences are all synonyms for single characters:</P>

      <H4>What Gets Matched</H4>
      <P>When there is more that one way to match a regular expression, the "best" 
         possible match is obtained using the <A href="syntax_leftmost_longest.html">leftmost-longest 
            rule</A>.</P>
      <H3>Variations</H3>
      <H4>Egrep<A name="egrep"></H4>
      <P>When an expression is compiled with the flag <EM>egrep</EM> set, then the 
         expression is treated as a newline separated list of POSIX-Extended 
         expressions, a match is found if any of the expressions in the list match, for 
         example:</P>
      <PRE>boost::regex e("abc\ndef", boost::regex::egrep);</PRE>
      <P>will match either of the POSIX-Basic expressions "abc" or "def".</P>
      <P>As its name suggests, this behavior is consistent with the Unix utility <EM>egrep</EM>, 
         and with <EM>grep</EM> when used with the -E option.</P>
      <H4>awk<A name="awk"></A></H4>
      <P>In addition to the <A href="#extended">POSIX-Extended features</A>&nbsp;the 
         escape character is special inside a character class declaration.&nbsp;</P>
      <P>In addition, some escape sequences that are not defined as part of 
         POSIX-Extended specification are required to be supported - however Boost.Regex 
         supports these by default anyway.</P>
      <H3><A name="options"></A>Options</H3>
      <P>There are a <A href="syntax_option_type.html#extended">variety of flags</A> that 
         may be combined with the <EM>extended</EM> and <EM>egrep</EM> options when 
         constructing the regular expression, in particular note that the <A href="syntax_option_type.html#extended">
            newline_alt</A> option alters the syntax, while the <A href="syntax_option_type.html#extended">
            collate, nosubs&nbsp;and icase</A> options modify how the case and locale 
         sensitivity are to be applied.</P>
