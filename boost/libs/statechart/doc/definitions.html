<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The boost::fsm documentation uses a lot of terminology specific to state 
machines. Most of it is equal to the one used in the UML specifications. This 
document contains only definitions for terminology not used by UML.</p>

<h3><a name="Context">Context</a></h3>
<p>The direct context of a state is either its outer state or the state 
machine. In the latter case the state is an outermost state.</p>
<h3><a name="Innermost common outer state">Innermost common outer state</a></h3>
<p>The innermost common outer state of two states is the first direct or 
indirect outer state that both states have in common. Also known as Least 
Common Ancestor (UML).</p>
<h3><a name="Innermost state">Innermost state</a></h3>
<p>An innermost state is a state that does not itself have inner states. Also 
known as leaf state or simple state (UML). Note that <code>
boost::fsm::simple_state</code> is <b>not</b> a model of the UML simple state.</p>
<h3><a name="In-state reaction">In-state reaction</a></h3>
<p>An in-state reaction is a <a href="#Reaction">reaction</a> that neither 
exits nor enters any states. Also known as inner transition or internal 
transition (UML).</p>
<h3><a name="Outermost state">Outermost state</a></h3>
<p>An outermost state is a state that does not itself have outer states. Note 
that an outermost state is different from a UML top state. A state machine can 
have an arbitrary number of the former but only exactly one of the latter. 
boost::fsm only supports outermost states.</p>
<h3><a name="Polymorphic events">Polymorphic events</a></h3>
<p>An FSM library supports polymorphic events if events can inherit from each 
other without restrictions <b>and</b> allows the definition of reactions for 
leafs <b>and</b> nodes of the resulting event inheritance tree.</p>
<p>Example (using a hypothetical fsm library, as boost::fsm does not support 
polymorphic events):</p>
<pre>struct EvButtonPressed : Event // node
{
  /* common button pressed properties */
};

struct EvPlayButtonPressed : EvButtonPressed {}; // leaf
struct EvStopButtonPressed : EvButtonPressed {}; // leaf
struct EvForwardButtonPressed : EvButtonPressed {}; // leaf</pre>
<p>If a state machine needs to react whenever <b>any</b> button (including the 
ones that may be added in the future) is pressed, a reaction for <code>
EvButtonPressed</code> can be defined.</p>
<h3><a name="Reaction">Reaction</a></h3>
<p>A reaction consists of all the side effects caused by the processing of one 
event. Reactions can be categorized as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In-state reaction</li>
  <li>Event deferral</li>
  <li>Transition</li>
  <li>Termination, also known as transition to the final state (UML)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that it is possible to mix a reaction of type 1 with one of the other 
types (the in-state reaction is always executed first) but it is not possible 
to mix a reaction of type 2-4 with anything else but type 1.</p>
<p>A reaction is always associated with exactly one state type and exactly one 
event type.</p>
<h3><a name="Unstable state">Unstable state</a></h3>
<p>A state is unstable from the moment when it has been entered until just 
before its last direct inner state is entered.</p>
<h3><a name="Unstable state machine">Unstable state machine</a></h3>
<p>A state machine is unstable if at least one of its currently active states 
is unstable. This is the case during the following three operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Initiation: From the moment after the first state has been entered until 
  right before the last state of the initial state configuration is entered</li>
  <li>Transition: From the moment after the first state has been exited until 
  right before the last state is entered</li>
  <li>Termination: From the moment after the first state has been exited until 
  right before the last state is exited</li>
</ul>
<p>Under normal circumstances a state machine has Run-To-Completion semantics, 
that is, processing of an event is fully completed before the machine returns 
to the client or before the next event is dequeued. Therefore, a state machine 
is usually only unstable when it is busy processing an event and becomes 
stable again right before it has finished processing the event. However, this 
can not be guaranteed when either transition actions or entry actions fail 
(exit actions cannot fail). Such a failure is reported by an event, which must 
be processed while the state machine is unstable. However, exception event 
processing rules ensure that a state machine cannot be unstable when it 
returns to the client (see <code>state_machine&lt;&gt;::process_event</code> for 
details).</p>
