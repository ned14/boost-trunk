**** Candide ****

In the country of Westphalia, in the castle of the most noble Baron of Thunder-t
en-tronckh, lived a youth whom Nature had endowed with a most sweet disposition.
 His face was the true index of his mind. He had a solid judgment joined to the
most unaffected simplicity; and hence, I presume, he had his name of Candide. Th
e old servants of the house suspected him to have been the son of the Baron's si
ster, by a very good sort of a gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that young la
dy refused to marry, because he could produce no more than threescore and eleven
 quarterings in his arms; the rest of the genealogical tree belonging to the fam
ily having been lost through the injuries of time....
