<h3><a name="functiontemplateordering">Partial Function Template Ordering</a></h3>
Not all C++ compilers correctly support partial function template ordering (PFTO).
For these compilers, the following code will fail to compile:
<pre><code>
template&lt;class Archive, class T&gt;
void serialize(
    Archive & ar, 
    T & t, 
    const unsigned int file_version
){
    ...
}

template&lt;class Archive, class T&gt;
void serialize(
    Archive & ar, 
    my_template&lt;T&gt & t, 
    const unsigned int file_version
){
    ...
}
</pre></code>
The serialization library works around this issue by using a different
default definition of the first template:
<pre><code>
template&lt;class Archive, class T&gt;
void serialize(
    Archive & ar, 
    T & t, 
    const unsigned long int file_version  // Note: change to long
){
    ...
}
</pre></code>
Now, the second template is not matched with the first one so there
is no PFTO and no compile error.  When the serialization library invokes
<pre><code>
serialize(ar, t, 0);
</pre></code>
the function declaration is first matched against templates with
an integer for the third argument.  If there is a match, the matching
template is instantiated and later invoked.  If there is no match,
an attempt is made to match other templates by converting arguments to other types.
In this case the third argument can be converted to long to match
the first template - which is the default.  So in this case, the first
template will be instantiated and later invoked.  We have managed to
use function overloading to achieve the same effect as PFTO
were it correctly implemented.
<p>
This depends upon undefined behavior of a compiler already
determined to be non-conforming.  In other words, there is no 
guarantee that this will work on all compilers.  If a compiler does not
correctly support PFTO and this method cannot be used to workaround
it, non-intrusive serialization cannot be supported for that compiler.
As of this writing, such a compiler has not been encountered.
<p>
It turns out that using this "trick" can create problems with
compilers that DO correctly support PFTO.  For this reason we
define a macro <code style="white-space: normal">BOOST_PTFO</code> which 
is defined to be <code style="white-space: normal">long</code>
for non-conforming compilers and nothing for conforming ones. So
the default definition is really:
The serialization library works around this issue by using a different
default definition of the first template:
<pre><code>
template&lt;class Archive, class T&gt;
void serialize(
    Archive & ar, 
    T & t, 
    const unsigned BOOST_PFTO int file_version  // Note: change to BOOST_PFTO
){
    ...
}
</pre></code>

<h3><a name="charencoding">Character Encoding</a></h3>
The whole question of character encoding combined with wide characters
is much more complicated than it would seem to be. The current library
defines in 3 formats (text, binary, and XML), wide and narrow characters, 
an attempts to be portable between compiler libraries.  The results of 
a rather long consideration of all these factors has been to set
default encoding according to the following rules.
<ul>
  <li>All text archives (i.e. <code style="white-space: normal">text_?archive</code>) will produce
      text output in the current stream <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code>.  Generally this will
      produce no changes in string data.
  <li>To produce binary output with Microsoft compilers, the stream
      will have to be opened with mode <code style="white-space: normal">ios::binary</code>.
      Failure to do so will result in 0x0d characters (carriage-return)
      characters being removed from the input stream if they are followed
      by a 0x0a character (line-feed).  This could corrupt the input
      and make the file unreadable.  On UNIX systems the <code style="white-space: normal">ios::binary</code>
      is not required and is ignored if used.
  <li>character XML archives (i.e. xml_oarchive) will produce XML output
      with characters encoded according to the current stream <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code>.
  <li>wide character XML archives (i.e. xml_woarchive) will produce
      files encoded in UTF-8.
</ul>
This character encoding is implemented by changing the <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code> of the
i/o stream used by an archive when the archive is constructed, the stream
local is changed back to its original value. This action can be overridden 
by specifying <code style="white-space: normal">boost::archive::no_codecvt</code>
when the archive is opened.  In this case, the stream <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code> will
not be changed by the serialization library.
<p>
Note that the code conversion included for wide character text and XML
archives could alter <code style="white-space: normal">std::string</code> data stored in archives.
Suppose a normal (multi-byte) character string
is written to a wide character stream.  Our system uses the current <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code>
to translate it to a wide character string before writing it out.  
Upon reading, it is translated back to a (multi-byte)string. 
If the <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code> on the platform that reads the archive is different than 
the <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code> on the platform that wrote the stream, the actual string data
may be altered by the serialization process. To avoid this, either
avoid usage of <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code> dependent multi-byte strings or be sure that
the <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code> is set correctly before reading the archive.
<p>
To produce wide character text output (i.e. 16 bit characters on Win32 systems),
do the following.
<ul>
  <li>Open a wide character stream.
  <li>Alter the stream <code style="white-space: normal">locale</code> to use 
     <code style="white-space: normal">boost::archive::codecvt_null&lt;OStream::char_type&gt;</code>
  <li>Create the archive with the flag <code style="white-space: normal">no_codecvt</code>.
</ul>
Naturally, the input process has to be symmetrical.
<h3><a name="partialtemplatespecialization">Partial Template Specialization</a></h3>
Compilers which fail to support partial template specialization will fail to compile
the following code.  To make this compiler, the <code style="white-space: normal">const</code> has to be removed.
<pre><code>
void f(A const* a, text_oarchive& oa)
{
  oa << a;
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="tempatesyntax">Template Invocation syntax</a></h3>
Some compilers may not recognize the syntax:
<pre><code>
ar.template register_type&lt;T&gt;();
</code></pre>
for "registering" derived pointers of polymorphic classes.  The actual 
function prototype is:
<pre><code>
template&lt;T&gt;
void register_type(T * t = NULL);
</code></pre>
so that one may write <code style="white-space: normal">ar.register_type(static_cast&lt;T *&gt;(NULL))</code> instead of
the syntax described above.
</ul>
<h3><a name="othercompilerissues">Specific Compiler/Library Issues</a></h3>

<h4><a name="gcc3x">GCC 3.X</a></h4>
GCC versions for Cygwin and MinGW fail to support wide character I/O.  
So all tests using wide char I/O fail.  Note that if wide character I/O support
is added with STLPort, all tests complete successfully.
<h4><a name="gcc295">GCC 2.95</a></h4>
All of the above plus:<br>
<ul>
    <li>The serialization library depends on the templeted stream implemention
    to function properly.  So STLPort must be used to build the library.
    <li>Polymorphic archive tests fail.
</ul>
<h4><a name="Intel80">Intel C++ 8.0</a></h4>
No known issues. All tests compile and run in debug and release modes.
<h4><a name="vc71">Visual C++ 7.1</a></h4>
No known issues. All tests compile and run in debug and release modes.
<h4><a name="vc70">Visual C++ 7.0</a></h4>
<ul>
    <li>The "pimpl" demo fails to link.  Cause and workaround for this is unknown
    <li>XML serialization only works with version 1.6x of spirit.  In order to build and use this
    library with this compiler, one must use version 1.6x rather than the latest version
    shipped with boost.  See <a href="release.html#Installation">Release Notes</a>.
</ul>
<h4><a name="vc6">Visual C++ 6.0</a></h4>
all the above issues for Visual C++ 7.0 plus:
<ul>
    <li>Out of line template definitions are not recognized and fail with a confusing
    error message.  To function save/load/serialize member function templates must be defined
    within the class definition.  This feature is essential to <code style="white-space: normal">demo_pimpl</code>. Hence,
    this program will fail to compile.  In this case the problem can't be worked around and
    still demonstrate this facility.
    <li>This compiler does not support <code style="white-space: normal">wchar_t</code> as a separate type.  It defines
    <code style="white-space: normal">wchar_t</code> as an alias for <code style="white-space: normal">short int</code>.  In general things will still
    function.  However certain customization, such as overloading archive operators for
    saving/loading wide character arrays would produce surprises in this environment.
    <li>Under certain circumstances, a program will fail to link with the message:
    LIN1179 - "invalid or corrupt file: duplicate comdat".  According
    to <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?th=8a05c82c4ffee280">
    http://groups.google.com/groups?th=8a05c82c4ffee280
    </a> (look for P78)
    A LNK1179 error occurs when:
    <ul>
        <li>The template class takes at least two arguments.
        <li>The template is used at least two times with identical first
        and different second arguments.
        <li>The static member variable is of an object type with at least one
        base class. (In another scenario it also occurred using a member
        without a base class.)
    </ul>
    Working around this in the implementation of the library for this compiler
    entailed a ridiculous amount of effort.  Even so, the effort wasn't entirely succesful.
    With this compiler, this message will still appear under the following conditions:
    <ul>
        <li>When serializing a class with multiple base classes.  This problem causes two 
        failure in the test suite.  I have been unable to divise a way to work around this.
        <li>Using more than one kind of archive in the same code module. This should be easy 
        to work around in practice.
    </ul>
    <li>Code modules exceeding some undetermined size that use the library will fail with
    <i>fatal error C1204: compiler limit : internal structure overflow</i>.  This can be addressed
    by dividing the module into smaller ones.
</ul>
<h4><a name="borland564">Borland 5.64</a></h4>
<ul>
    <li><code style="white-space: normal">enum</code> data members cannot be serialized.
    Conversion to/from integers will work around the problem.
    <li>Default array serialization fails.  Workaround this by doing it with a loop.
    <li>If class serialize functions are not accessable either by making them public or by
    including <code style="white-space: normal">friend</code> declarations as described in 
    <a href="serialization.html#member">Class Serialization - Member Function</a>, the
    will compile but fail at runtime.
    <li>tests using custom extended type which doesn't use rtti fails.
</ul>
<h4><a name="borland551">Borland 5.51 and earlier</a></h4>
All of the above issues for Borland 5.64 plus:
<ul>
    <li>Most tests using Wide character XML files fail. This happens somewhere within the
    spirit library but we've been unable to track it further than this.
    <li>A couple of other tests fail.
</ul>
<h4><a name="dinkumware">Dinkumware Library</a></h4>
Several compilers, including Visual C++ 6.0, use an older dinkumware library.  
These platforms have several issues: 
<ul>
    <li>The dinkumware library shipped with this compiler does not change the locale facet
    of an i/o stream unless the <code style="white-space: normal">imbue</code> function is called before the the
    stream is opened.  In order to use this library with this environment to generate UTF-8
    files, one cannot depend on the "automatic" setting of local that archives implement. The
    stream local must be set explicitly on the stream before an archive is opened on it.  The
    archive should be opened with the <code style="white-space: normal">no_codecvt</code> flag.  Note this problem will
    occur on all compilers shipped with this library.
    <li>Other issues have been worked around in the file.
