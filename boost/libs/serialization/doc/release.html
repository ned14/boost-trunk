This is the Boost 1.32 Serialization Library.
There are currently no known bugs. However, due to compiler/library quirks and or 
bugs, some tests fail.
<h2><a name="requirements"></a>Requirements</h2>
This library requires Boost version 1.32 or later.  Depending on the compiler used,
It may also require spirit 1.6x which is not part of the standard boost distribution.
<p>
The serialization library requires the boost spirit package to load XML archives.
We have found that all tests pass using spirit 1.6x. Spirit 1.8 and higher does not work with
older compilers - specificallly MSVC 6, Borland and GCC < 3.0.
If you are using one of these two compilers, you may download a version
of spirit 1.6 <a href="http://spirit.sourceforge.net/index.php?doc=download/index.html">here</a>.
To use this downloaded version rather than the one included with boost,
set an environmental variable SPIRIT_ROOT to be equal to the root 
directory where the downloaded copy of spirit has been placed. E. G.
<pre><code>
set SPIRIT_ROOT=c:/spirit161
</code></pre>
If you're not using bjam and the jamfile to build the library, be sure that
the directory which contains the version of spirit you plan to use is placed
at the front of the list of include paths.

<h2><a name="recent_improvements"></a>Differences from Draft #20</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Support for <em>Argument Dependent Looup</em> for serialization override invocations.
    <li>Enhanced documentation to help explain usage of the above.
    <li>Adjustments to improve support for less conformant compilers.
    <li>A few bug fixes.
</ul>

<h2><a name="todo"></a>Pending issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Compile, and test on more platforms
    <li>implement <code>is_virtual_base&lt;T&gt;</code> to automatically
    eliminate redundancy in virtual base class serialization.
    <li>currently can't serialize through a pointer an object a of class
    that implements its own <code style="white-space: normal">new/delete</code> operators.
</ul>
