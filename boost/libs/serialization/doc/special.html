<h3><a name="derivedpointers">Pointers to Objects of Derived Classes</a></h3>
<h4><a name="registration">Registration</a></h4>
Consider the following:
<pre><code>
class base {
    ...
};
class derived_one : public base {
    ...
};
class derived_two : public base {
    ...
};
main(){
    ...
    base *b;
    ar &amp; b; 
}
</code></pre>
When loading <code style="white-space: normal">b</code> what kind of object should be created? 
An object of class <code style="white-space: normal">derived_one</code>,
<code style="white-space: normal">derived_two</code>, or maybe <code style="white-space: normal">base</code>?
<p>
If this situation is not addressed by one of the methods described below,
an <a target="detail" href="exceptions.html#unregistered_class">
<code style="white-space: normal">unregistered_class</code></a> exception will be thrown when serialization is
invoked.
<p>Many times this situation is resolved automatically by the serialization
library.
<p>
The system "registers" each class in an archive the first time an object of that
class it is serialized and assigns a sequential number to it.  Next time an
object of that class is serialized in that same archive, this number is written
in the archive.  So every class is identified uniquely within the archive.  
When the archive is read back in, each new sequence number is re-associated with 
the class being read.  Note that this implies that "registration" has to occur
during both save and load so that the class-integer table built on load
is identical to the class-integer table built on save. In fact, the key to
whole serialization system is that things are always saved and loaded in
the same sequence.  This includes "registration"
<p>
In many situations the problem never comes up. Consider:
<pre><code>
main(){
    derived_one d1;
    derived_two d2:
    ...
    ar &gt;&gt; d1;
    ar &gt;&gt; d2;
    // A side effect of serialization of objects d1 and d2 is that
    // the classes derived_one and derived_two become known to the archive.
    // So subsequent serialization of those classes by base pointer works
    // without any special considerations.
    base *b;
    ar &amp; b; 
}
</code></pre>
Here, the problem doesn't present itself. When <code style="white-space: normal">b</code> is read it is
preceded by a unique (to the archive) class identifier which
has previously been related to class <code style="white-space: normal">derived_one</code> or
<code style="white-space: normal">derived_two</code>.
<p>
If a derived class hasn't been automatically "registered" as described
above, we have the option of registering it explicitly.  All archives are
derived from a base class which implements the following template:
<pre><code>
template&lt;class T&gt;
register_type();
</code></pre>
So our problem could just as well be addressed by writing:
<pre><code>
main(){
    ...
    ar.template register_type&lt;derived_one&gt;();
    ar.template register_type&lt;derived_two&gt;();
    base *b;
    ar &amp; b; 
}
</code></pre>
Note that if the serialization function is split between save and load, both
functions must include the registration.  This is required to keep the save
and corresponding load in syncronization.
<p>
This will work but may be inconvenient.  We don't always know which derived
classes we are going to serialize when we write the code to serialize through
a base class pointer.  Every time a new derived class is written we have to
go back to all the places where the base class is serialized and update the
code.
<p>
So we have another method:
<pre><code>
#include &lt;boost/serialization/export.hpp&gt;
...
BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID(derived_one, "derived_one")
BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID(derived_two, "derived_two")

main(){
    ...
    base *b;
    ar &amp; b; 
}
</code></pre>
The macro <code style="white-space: normal">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID</code> associates a string literal
with a class. In the above example we've used a string rendering
of the class name. If a object of such an "exported" class is serialized
through a pointer and is otherwise unregistered, the "export" string is 
included in the archive. When the archive 
is later read, the string literal is used to find the class which 
should be created by the serialization library.
This permits each class to be in a separate header file along with its 
string identifier. There is no need to maintain a separate "pre-registration" 
of derived classes that might be serialized.  This method of
registration is referred to as "key export".  More information on this
topic is found in the section Class Traits - 
<a target="detail" href="traits.html#export">Export Key</a>.
<p>
<h4><a name="instantiation">Instantiation</a></h4>
Registration by means of any of the above methods fulfill another role 
whose importance might not be obvious.  This system relies on templated
functions of the form <code style="white-space: normal">template&lt;class Archive, class T&gt;</code>.
This means that serialization code must be instantiated for each
combination of archive and data type that is serialized in the program.
<p>
Polymorphic pointers of derived classes may never be referred to 
explictly by the program so normally code to serialize such classes
would never be instantiated.  So in addition to including export key
strings in an archive, <code style="white-space: normal">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID</code> explicitly
instantiates the class serialization code for all archive classes used 
by the program.  
<p>
In order to do this, 
<a href="../../../boost/serialization/export.hpp" target="export_hpp">export.hpp</a>
includes meta programming code to build a <code style="white-space: normal">mpl::list</code>  
of all the file types used by the module by checking for definition of the header 
inclusion guards.

Using this list,  
<code style="white-space: normal">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID</code> will explicitly instantiate serialization
code for all exported classes.
For this implementaton to function, the header file 
<a href="../../../boost/serialization/export.hpp" target="export_hpp">export.hpp</a>
has to come after all the archive header files.  This is enforced
by code at the end of the header file:
<a href="../../../boost/archive/basic_archive.hpp" target="basic_archive_hpp">basic_archive.hpp</a>
which will trip a STATIC_ASSERT if this requirement is violated.

<h4><a name="selectivetracking">Selective Tracking</a></h4>
Whether or not an object is tracked is determined by its
<a target="detail" href="traits.html#tracking">object tracking trait</a>.
The default setting for user defined types is <code style="white-space: normal">track_selectively</code>.
That is, track objects if and only if they are serialized through pointers anywhere
in the program. Any  objects that are "registered" by any of the above means are presumed
to be serialized through pointers somewhere in the program and therefore
would be tracked. In certain situations this could lead to an inefficiency.
Suppose we have a class module used by multiple programs.  Because
some programs serializes polymorphic pointers to objects of this class, we 
<a target="detail" href="traits.html#export">export</a> a class
identifier by specifying <code style="white-space: normal">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT</code> in the
class header.  When this module is included by another program,
objects of this class will always be tracked even though it
may not be necessary.  This situation could be addressed by using 
<a target="detail" href="traits.html#tracking"><code style="white-space: normal">track_never</code></a>  
in those programs.
<p>
It could also occur that even though a program serializes through 
a pointer, we are more concerned with efficiency than avoiding the
the possibility of creating duplicate objects.  It could be
that we happen to know that there will be no duplicates.  It could
also be that the creation of a few duplicates is benign and not
worth avoiding given the runtime cost of tracking duplicates.
Again, <a target="detail" href="traits.html#tracking"><code style="white-space: normal">track_never</code></a>  
can be used.
<h4><a name="runtimecasting">Runtime Casting</a></h4>
In order to properly translate between base and derived pointers
at runtime, the system requires each base/derived pair be found
in a table.  A side effect of serializing a base object with
<code style="white-space: normal">boost::serialization::base_object&lt;Base&gt;(Derived &)</code>
is to ensure that the base/derived pair is added to the table
before the <code style="white-space: normal">main</code> function is entered.
This is very convenient and results in a clean syntax.  The only
problem is that it can occur where a derived class serialized
through a pointer has no need to invoke the serialization of
its base class.  In such a case, there are two choices.  The obvious
one is to invoke the base class serialization with <code style="white-space: normal">base_object</code>
and specify an empty function for the base class serialization.
The alternative is to "register" the Base/Derived relationship
explicitly by invoking the template 
<code style="white-space: normal">void_cast_register&lt;Base, Derived&gt;();</code>.
Note that this usage of the term "register" is not related
to its usage in the previous section.  Here is an example of how this is done:
<pre><code>
#include &lt;sstream&gt;
#include &lt;boost/serialization/serialization.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/archive/text_iarchive.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/serialization/export.hpp&gt;

class base {
    friend class boost::serialization::access;
    //...
    // only required when using method 1 below
    // no real serialization required - specify a vestigial one
    template&lt;class Archive&gt;
    void serialize(Archive &amp; ar, const unsigned int file_version){}
};

class derived : public base {
    friend class boost::serialization::access;
    template&lt;class Archive&gt;
    void serialize(Archive &amp; ar, const unsigned int file_version){
        // method 1 : invoke base class serialization
        boost::serialization::base_object&lt;base&gt;(*this);
        // method 2 : explicitly register base/derived relationship
        boost::serialization::void_cast_register&lt;base, derived&gt;();
    }
};

BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID(derived, "derived")

main(){
    //...
    std::stringstream ss;
    boost::archive::text_iarchive ar(ss);
    base *b;
    ar &gt;&gt; b; 
}
</code></pre>

<h3><a name="objecttracking">Object Tracking</a></h3>
Depending on how the class is used and other factors, serialized objects
may be tracked by memory address.  This prevents the same object from being
written to or read from an archive multiple times. This could cause problems in 
progams where the copies of different objects are serialized from the same address.
<pre><code>
template&lt;class Archive&gt;
void save(boost::basic_oarchive  &amp; ar, const unsigned int version) const
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i){
        A x = a[i];
        ar &lt;&lt; x;
    }
}
</code></pre>
In this case, the data to be saved exists on the stack.  Each iteration
of the loop updates the value on the stack.  So although the data changes
each iteration, the address of the data doesn't.  If a[i] is an array of
objects being tracked by memory address, the library will skip storing
objects after the first as it will be assumed that objects at the same address
are really the same object.
<p>
To help detect such cases, output archive operators expect to be passed
<code style="white-space: normal">const</code> reference arguments.
<p>
Given this, the above code will invoke a compile time assertion.
The obvious fix in this example is to use
<pre><code>
template&lt;class Archive&gt;
void save(boost::basic_oarchive &amp; ar, const unsigned int version) const
{
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i){
        ar &lt;&lt; a[i];
    }
}
</code></pre>
which will compile and run without problem.  
<p>
The usage of <code style="white-space: normal">const</code> by the output archive operators
will ensure that the process of serialization doesn't
change the state of the objects being serialized.  An attempt to do this
would constitute augmentation of the concept of saving of state with
some sort of non-obvious side effect. This would almost surely be a mistake 
and a likely source of very subtle bugs.  As described 
<a target="detail" href="traits.html#tracking">above</a>, 
addresses of objects serialized as pointers are stored in memory to
prevent saving/loading of duplicate objects.  These stored addresses
can also be used to delete objects created during a loading process
that has been interrupted by throwing of an exception.  By default, code 
to implement this tracking is instantiated if and only if an object of the class
is serialized through a pointer.  If it is known a priori that no pointer
values are duplicated, overhead associated with object tracking can
be eliminated by setting the object tracking class serialization trait
appropriately.
<p>
By definition, data types designated primitive by 
<a target="detail" href="traits.html#level">Implementation Level</a>
class serialization trait are never tracked. If it is desired to
track a shared primitive object through a pointer (e.g. a
<code style="white-space: normal">long</code> used as a reference count), It should be wrapped
in a class/struct so that it is an identifiable type.
The alternative of changing the implementation level of a <code style="white-space: normal">long</code>
would affect all <code style="white-space: normal">long</code>s serialized in the whole
program - probably not what one would intend.
<p>
It is possible that we may want to track addresses even though
the object is never serialized through a pointer.  For example,
a virtual base class need be saved/loaded only once.  By setting
this serialization trait to <code style="white-space: normal">track_always</code>, we can suppress 
redundant save/load operations.
<pre><code>
BOOST_CLASS_TRACKING(my_virtual_base_class, boost::serialization::track_always)
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="classinfo">Class Information</a></h3>
By default, for each class serialized, class information is written to the archive.
This information includes version number, implementation level and tracking
behavior.  This is necessary so that the archive can be correctly
deserialized even if a subsequent version of the program changes
some of the current trait values for a class.  The space overhead for
this data is minimal.  There is a little bit of runtime overhead
since each class has to be checked to see if it has already had its
class information included in the archive.  In some cases, even this
might be considered too much.  This extra overhead can be eliminated
by setting the 
<a target="detail" href="traits.html#level">implementation level</a>
class trait to: <code style="white-space: normal">boost::serialization::object_serializable</code>. 
<p>
<i>Turning off tracking and class information serialization will result
in pure template inline code that in principle could be optimised down
to a simple stream write/read.</i>  Elimination of all serialization overhead
in this manner comes at a cost.  Once archives are released to users, the
class serialization traits cannot be changed without invalidating the old
archives.  Including the class information in the archive assures us
that they will be readable in the future even if the class definition
is revised.  A light weight structure such as display pixel might be
declared in a header like this:

<pre><code>
#include &lt;boost/serialization/serialization.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/serialization/level.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/serialization/tracking.hpp&gt;

// a pixel is a light weight struct which is used in great numbers.
struct pixel
{
    unsigned char red, green, blue;
    template&lt;class Archive&gt;
    void serialize(Archive &amp; ar, const unsigned int /* version */){
        ar &lt;&lt; red &lt;&lt; green &lt;&lt; blue;
    }
};

// elminate serialization overhead at the cost of
// never being able to increase the version.
BOOST_CLASS_IMPLEMENTATION(pixel, boost::serialization::object_serializable);

// eliminate object tracking (even if serialized through a pointer)
// at the risk of a programming error creating duplicate objects.
BOOST_CLASS_TRACKING(pixel, boost::serialization::track_never)
</code></pre>

<h3><a name="portability">Archive Portability</a></h3>
Several archive classes create their data in the form of text or portable a binary format.  
It should be possible to save such an of such a class on one platform and load it on another.  
This is subject to a couple of conditions.
<h4><a name="numerics">Numerics</a></h4>
The architecture of the machine reading the archive must be able hold the data
saved.  For example, the gcc compiler reserves 4 bytes to store a variable of type
<code style="white-space: normal">wchar_t</code> while other compilers reserve only 2 bytes.  
So its possible that   a value could be written that couldn't be represented by the loading program.  This is a
fairly obvious situation and easily handled by using the numeric types in
<a target="cstding" href="../../../boost/cstdint.hpp">&lt;boost/cstdint.hpp&gt;</a>

<h4><a name="traits">Traits</a></h4>
Another potential problem is illustrated by the following example:
<pre><code>
template&lt;class T&gt;
struct my_wrapper {
    template&lt;class Archive&gt;
    Archive & serialize ...
};

...

class my_class {
    wchar_t a;
    short unsigned b;
    template<&lt;class Archive&gt;
    Archive & serialize(Archive & ar, unsigned int version){
        ar & my_wrapper(a);
        ar & my_wrapper(b);
    }
};
</code></pre>
If <code style="white-space: normal">my_wrapper</code> uses default serialization
traits there could be a problem.  With the default traits, each time a new type is
added to the archive, bookkeeping information is added. So in this example, the
archive would include such bookkeeping information for 
<code style="white-space: normal">my_wrapper&lt;wchar_t&gt;</code> and for
<code style="white-space: normal">my_wrapper&lt;short_unsigned&gt;</code>.
Or would it?  What about compilers that treat 
<code style="white-space: normal">wchar_t</code> as a
synonym for <code style="white-space: normal">unsigned short</code>?
In this case there is only one distinct type - not two.  If archives are passed between
programs with compilers that differ in their treatment 
of <code style="white-space: normal">wchar_t</code> the load operation will fail
in a catastrophic way.
<p>
One remedy for this is to assign serialization traits to the template
<code style="white-space: normal">my_template</code> such that class
information for instantiations of this template is never serialized.  This 
process is described <a target="detail" href="traits.html#templates">above</a> and
has been used for <a target="detail" href="wrappers.html#nvp"><strong>Name-Value Pairs</strong></a>.
Wrappers would typically be assigned such traits.
<p>
Another way to avoid this problem is to assign serialization traits
to all specializations of the template <code style="white-space: normal">my_wrapper</code>
for all primitive types so that class information is never saved.  This is what has
been done for our implementation of serializations for STL collections.

<h3><a name="binary_archives">Binary Archives</a></h3>
Standard stream i/o on some systems will expand linefeed characters to carriage-return/linefeed 
on output. This creates a problem for binary archives.  The easiest way to handle this is to 
open streams for binary archives in "binary mode" by using the flag 
<code style="white-space: normal">ios::binary</code>.  If this is not done, the archive generated
will be unreadable.
<p>
Unfortunately, no way has been found to detect this error before loading the archive.  Debug builds
will assert when this is detected so that may be helpful in catching this error.

<h3><a name="xml_archives">XML Archives</a></h3>
XML archives present a somewhat special case. 
XML format has a nested structure that maps well to the "recursive class member visitor" pattern 
used by the serialization system. However, XML differs from other formats in that it 
requires a name for each data member. Our goal is to add this information to the 
class serialization specification while still permiting the the serialization code to be 
used with any archive. This is achived by requiring that all data serialized to an XML archive
be serialized as a <a target="detail" href="wrappers.html#nvp">name-value pair</a>.
The first member is the name to be used as the XML tag for the
data item while the second is a reference to the data item itself. Any attempt to serialize data
not wrapped in a in a <a target="detail" href="wrappers.html#nvp">name-value pair</a> will
be trapped at compile time. The system is implemented in such a way that for other archive classes,
just the value portion of the data is serialized. The name portion is discarded during compilation.
So by always using <a target="detail" href="wrappers.html#nvp">name-value pairs</a>, it will
be guarenteed that all data can be serialized to all archive classes with maximum efficiency.
