<h1>Boost.Compatibilty library</h1>

<p>
This library provides workarounds which allow the other Boost libraries
to be used on otherwise non-conforming platforms. We hope that it will
be possible to remove this library at some time in the future as
standard library suppliers become more conforming.

<p>
Currently the Boost.Compatibilty library only contains one Python script:
<tt>generate_cpp_c_headers.py</tt>.
This Python script creates a full set of C++ C header files
(e.g. &lt;cstdio&gt;) that are missing on some platforms.
The header files created by this script reside in the directory
<tt>root/boost/compatibility/cpp_c_headers</tt>.
To use the header files, add this directory to the include
file search path. For example:

<pre>
cxx -I/usr/local/boost/boost/compatibility/cpp_c_headers ...
</pre>

<p>
Supported platforms are:
<ul>
<li>Compaq Alpha, RedHat 6.2 Linux, Compaq C++ V6.3 (cxx)
<li>Compaq Alpha, Tru64 Unix V5.0, Compaq C++ V6.2 (cxx)
<li>Silicon Graphics, IRIX 6.5, MIPSpro Compilers: Version 7.3.1.1m (CC)
</ul>

<p>
There are more powerful alternatives to using
the Boost.Compatibility library, e.g.
<a href="http://www.stlport.org/">STLport</a> or
<a href="http://www-pat.fnal.gov/personal/wb/boost/">ISOCXX</a>.
However, in contrast to these alternatives, the
<tt>generate_cpp_c_headers.py</tt> script is very light-weight (less
than 100 non-comment lines of Python code), much less ambitious,
significantly easier to maintain and therefore more suitable as an
intermin workaround.
