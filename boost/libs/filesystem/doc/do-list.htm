Do-list</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Finish the probe program, and ask Boost people to run it on various O/S's.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Finish portability guide and checking functions. Get opinions on default, Boost, and other error checks.&nbsp; POSIX?&nbsp; 
  Windows? Mac?&nbsp; ISO 6990?<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Cyclic paths:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>General requirements.</li>
    <li>Add cycle-breaking code if needed.</li>
    <li>Add test case to make sure functions like <i>remove_all</i> don't loop.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>As a lexical concept, parent-directory is portable unless it escapes to 
  the operating system. But do all operating recognize such a concept in a path?&nbsp; 
  I doubt it.&nbsp; Maybe there should be a checking function that verifies that 
  generic_path() contains no <code>&quot;..&quot;</code>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Once the review is complete, ask for help porting to the Mac, etc.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>From John Maddock:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&gt;All the functions generic_path, file_path, directory_path, leaf, and 
&gt;branch,
&gt;are under-documented IMO. I had to read the specs quite closely before I
&gt;could figure out which did what. Adding examples to each would probably be
&gt;a help, or maybe a &quot;description&quot; section that provides a less terse
&gt;description than the standardese.</pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Change remove() to return a bool, now that the file doesn't have to 
  exist..&nbsp; (Keith Burton)</li>
