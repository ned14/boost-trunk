<p>The original idea of passing two extra parameters to REPEAT, which makes it 
  possible to create preprocessor code on top of it, was due to Aleksey Gurtovoy. 
  The invokeable IDENTITY macro was also invented by him. He also suggested the 
  name for the library. Many thanks to Aleksey for his insights!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who participated in the review: David Abrahams, Beman Dawes, 
  Ronald Garcia, Douglas Gregor, Aleksey Gurtovoy, Jeremy Siek, and Daryle Walker.</p>
<p>Thanks to Chris Little and Mat Marcus for providing help with MWCW.</p>
<p>The PREPROCESSOR library has been developed by Vesa Karvonen. </p>
