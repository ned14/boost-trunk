If you have suggestions for additions or improvements to this library,
please e-mail such suggestions to boost@yahoogroups.com, but also cc
them to vesa.karvonen@housemarque.fi.

Issues:
- case studies
- more isolated examples & less complex examples in tutorial
-> Please e-mail suggestions to vesa.karvonen@housemarque.fi

Resolved for now:
- explanations of tricky issues with macro replacement
  - how macros are expanded, step-by-step examples
  - delay of # and ##
  - recursion prohibition
  -> Just refer to the standard. It is not the purpose of the documentation to teach C++.

- arithmetic
  - The preprocessor limitations seem to make it impossible to achieve both:
    - O(1) _size_ implementation of ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, ...
    - ease of use
  -> I have choosen ease of use and used O(N) size implementations
