General notes:
- The directory structure of this sample resembles the namespace structure
  of the different classes/templates out of which this sample consists.
  To make this clear, throughout the sample all #include's are given with 
  relation to the root folder of this sample (see next point!).
- The build process is straightforward. The only thing you should do 
  is to include the root directory of this sample into the include search
  path of your compiler (usually through a -I. command line argument).
- The different test files and samples contained in this library require
  the program_options library from Vladimir Prus, which is currently under 
  Boost review (http://zigzag.cs.msu.su:7813/program_options).
