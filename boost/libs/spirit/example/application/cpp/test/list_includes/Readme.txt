The 'list_includes' sample shows a simple way to use the C preprocessor
iterator to extract a list of included files from a given source file. to 
get a hint, which commandline options are supported, call it with the --help
option.

Note: This sample requires the program_options library written by Vladimir Prus,
which is currently under Boost review. 
It is available here: http://zigzag.cs.msu.su:7813/program_options.

The build process is straightforward. The only thing you should do 
is to include the root directory of this sample into the include search
path of your compiler (usually through a -I. command line argument).
