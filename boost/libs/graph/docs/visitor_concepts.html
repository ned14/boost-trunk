Visitor Concepts
</H1>

<P>
The Visitor concept plays the same role in BGL as functors
play in the STL. Functors provide a mechanism for extending an
algorithm, for customizing what is done at each step of the algorithm.
Visitors allow the user to insert their own operations at various
steps within a graph algorithm.

<P>
The graph search algorithms include breadth and depth-first search,
Dijkstra's, Prim's, topological sort, Prim's, and connected
components.

<P>
There are two visitor concepts, Visitor and UserVisitor. The visitors
that the user passes into most BGL algorithms should model
UserVisitor.  The visitors used for some of the ``generalized''
algorithms and also for many of the internal BGL functions must model
Visitor.  We refer to these visitors as <I>foundation visitors</I>.
There are two differences between user-level visitors and foundation
visitors.  The first is that a foundation visitor will control the
progress of a graph search through the return value (<TT>true</TT> or
<TT>false</TT>) of its <TT>explore()</TT> method, which indicates
whether the target vertex needs to be explored. The user-level visitor
does <TT>explore()</TT> function has a <TT>void</TT> return type. The
second difference is that the UserVisitor has the extra requirement
for a category typedef which is explained in detail below. The
foundation visitors have the responsibility for handling the
user-level visitors, invoking them at the appropriate time based on
the visitor's category.
