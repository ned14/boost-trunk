<h2>Boost Graph Library Challenge and To-Do Items</h2>


<ul>

<li>Polish up code/docs for pending items and champion the formal
review. The pending items are:
  <ul>
   <li><tt>container_traits.hpp</tt>

   <li><tt>concept_checks.hpp</tt> 

   <li><tt>plugin.hpp</tt>

   <li>The queues and heaps: <tt>queue.hpp</tt>,
     <tt>mutable_queue.hpp</tt>, <tt>fibonacci_heap.hpp</tt>.
      Somehow merge implementation with Dietmer's heaps and queues.

   <li><tt>iterator_adaptor.hpp</tt> (need to figure out
    why this causes problems for VC++)

   <li><tt>disjoint_sets</tt> 
  </ul>

<li>Port the graph library to Borland C++</li>

<li>Port the graph library to Metrowerks C++</li>

<li>Construct a set of planar graph algorithms.</li>
  <ul>
   <li> Is the graph planar?
   <li> &quot;Walk around the block&quot; and similar open and closed neighborhood 
traversals. Note that edge traversals need to resolve to particular ends 
and sides (see below), not just to the edge as a whole.
   <li> Given a point, find the nearest vertex, edge, or bounded polygon. 
Again, edges are viewed as having left and right sides.
   <li> Given a line segment, find intersecting vertices, edges, or bounded 
polygons.
   <li> Given a polygon, find intersecting whatever...
   <li> Various minimum bounding rectangle and clipping problems.
   <li> Construct a planar embedding of a planar graph.
   <li> Find a balanced separator of a graph.
  </ul>

<li>Finish and test Maximum Flow algorithm.</li>

<li>Create an <tt>adjacency_matrix</tt> class that models
 the <a href="./AdjacencyMatrix.html">AdjacencyMatrix</a>
 concept.</li>

<li>Floyd-Warshall algorithm.</li>

<li>Rewrite the Qhull algorithm using the Boost Graph Library.</li>

<li>Explore the use of Algorithm Objects as an alternative to
  the current approach with visitors.

<li>Analyze the algorithms that do not yet have visitors, and
  come up with visitor interfaces for them.</li>

<li>Add a check in the adjacency_list class to make sure
  all the vertex property template arguments have kind=vertex_property_tag
  and all edge property template arguments have kind=edge_property_tag

</ul>
