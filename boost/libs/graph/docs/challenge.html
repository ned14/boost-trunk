<h2>Boost Graph Library Challenge and To-Do Items</h2>


<ul>

<li>Polish up code/docs for pending items and champion the formal
review. The pending items are:</li>
  <ul>
   <li><tt>container_traits.hpp</tt> (this should also include
     the work Matt Austern is doing on this topic)</li>

   <li><tt>concept_checks.hpp</tt> </li>

   <li><tt>property.hpp</tt></li>

   <li>The queues and heaps: <tt>queue.hpp</tt>,
     <tt>mutable_queue.hpp</tt>, <tt>fibonacci_heap.hpp</tt>.
      Somehow merge implementation with Dietmer's heaps and queues.</li>

   <li><tt>iterator_adaptor.hpp</tt> (need to figure out
    why this causes problems for VC++)</li>

   <li><tt>disjoint_sets</tt> </li>
  </ul>

<li>Port the graph library to Borland C++</li>

<li>Port the graph library to Metrowerks C++</li>

<li>Construct a set of planar graph algorithms.</li>
  <ul>
   <li> Is the graph planar?</li>
   <li> &quot;Walk around the block&quot; and similar open and closed neighborhood 
traversals. Note that edge traversals need to resolve to particular ends 
and sides (see below), not just to the edge as a whole.</li>
   <li> Given a point, find the nearest vertex, edge, or bounded polygon. 
Again, edges are viewed as having left and right sides.</li>
   <li> Given a line segment, find intersecting vertices, edges, or bounded 
polygons.</li>
   <li> Given a polygon, find intersecting whatever...</li>
   <li> Various minimum bounding rectangle and clipping problems.</li>
   <li> Construct a planar embedding of a planar graph.</li>
   <li> Find a balanced separator of a graph.</li>
   <li> Modify adjacency_list so that the out-edges can be ordered
    according to a user defined comparison object.</li>
  </ul>

<li>Finish and test Maximum Flow algorithm.</li>

<li>Create an <tt>adjacency_matrix</tt> class that models
 the <a href="./AdjacencyMatrix.html">AdjacencyMatrix</a>
 concept.</li>

<li>Floyd-Warshall algorithm.</li>

<li>Rewrite the Qhull algorithm using the Boost Graph Library.</li>

<li>Explore the use of Algorithm Objects as an alternative to
  the current approach with visitors.</li>

<li>Analyze the algorithms that do not yet have visitors, and
  come up with visitor interfaces for them.</li>

<li>Add a check in the adjacency_list class to make sure
  all the vertex property template arguments have kind=vertex_property_tag
  and all edge property template arguments have kind=edge_property_tag.</li>

<li>Clean up the output functions in graph_utility.hpp to
  use streams, and document all the utility functions. Replace
  the random number stuff with calls to the boost random number generator.</li>

<li>Modularize the tests in test/graph.cpp to apply to particular
  concepts. Make sure there are run-time tests for every BGL concept.</li>

<li>Write tests for the BGL algorithms. Currently the examples
  are used as a sanity check, but they do not constitute a real test. </li>

<li>Write up the examples from Knuth's <i>Stanford GraphBase</i> using
  the BGL. The file <a
  href="../examples/miles_span.cpp"><tt>examples/miles_span.cpp</tt></a>
  is a start.

<li>Create a class to support sub-graph views of a graph, where a
 sub-graph behaves just like a graph, but shares vertex and edge
 properties with the original graph. Perhaps even support sub-graphs
 of sub-graphs, etc.

</ul>
