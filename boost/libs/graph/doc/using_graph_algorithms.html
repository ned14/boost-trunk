<H1>Using the BGL Algorithms</H1>

<p>
This material is out of date and needs to be rewritten!!
</p>

<P>
All of the BGL algorithms have a lot in common when it comes to the
appearance of the interface and the setup the user must do in order to
call them. These common points are discussed here while the details of
the algorithms are discussed in the reference section for each
algorithm.  We will used <a
href="./dijkstra_shortest_paths.html">Dijsktra's single-source
shortest paths</a> algorithm as our first example. The following is
the declaration of the algorithm.

<P>
<PRE>
namespace boost {

  template &lt;class VertexListGraph, class P, class T, class R&gt;
  void
  dijkstra_shortest_paths(VertexListGraph&amp; g,
    typename graph_traits&lt;VertexListGraph&gt;::vertex_descriptor s,
    const bgl_named_params&lt;P, T, R&gt;&amp; params);

}
</PRE>

<P>

<H2>The Graph Parameter</H2>

<P>
Of course the most important parameter of the function is the graph
object <TT>g</TT>. The name of the template type
<TT>VertexListGraph</TT> is used to remind the user that graph classes
used with Dijkstra's algorithm must model the <a
href="./VertexListGraph.html">VertexListGraph</a> concept. This
basically means that the graph class must provide <TT>vertices()</TT>,
<TT>out_edges()</TT>, and the other functions and associated types
required by <a href="./VertexListGraph.html">VertexListGraph</a>. Most
BGL graph classes support these operations, though <TT>edge_list</TT>
is a notable exception. You can look in the <B>Model Of</B> section of
the graph class documentation to find out which operations are
supported by the graph.

<P>
It is also important to note whether the algorithm works on only
undirected graphs or whether it also applies to directed graphs
(undirected graphs are a special kind of directed graph). This
information always appears in the description of the graph parameter
in the reference section for the algorithm.

<P>

<H2>The Vertex Parameter</H2>

<P>
The next parameter, <TT>Vertex s</TT>, is the source vertex from which
we want to calculate the shortests paths. The object <TT>s</TT> must be
a vertex desriptor of the graph object. The following code snippet
shows how one would declare a vertex descriptor object.

<P>
<PRE>
  typedef ... Graph;
  Graph G;
  // fill in G with vertices and edges ...

  boost::graph_traits&lt;Graph&gt;::vertex_descriptor s;
</PRE>

<P>
The vertex <TT>s</TT> needs to be initialized so that it points to
some vertex in the graph. There are several ways to obtain a vertex
descriptor object from the graph, and which method you use will often
depend on the situation. The <TT>vertices()</TT> function provides
access to all the vertices in the graph through iterators, and the
<TT>source()</TT> and <TT>target()</TT> functions give the vertices
incident to an edge. Here we will simply grab the vertex at the
beginning of the graph's vertex set. The <TT>tie()</TT> function
provides a convenient way to assign the pair of iterators returned by
<TT>vertices()</TT> to the <TT>viter</TT> and <TT>viter_end</TT>
variables. The vertex iterator dereferences to give a vertex
descriptor object.

<P>
<PRE>
  boost::graph_traits&lt;Graph&gt;::vertex_iterator viter, viter_end;
  boost::tie(viter, viter_end) = vertices(G);
  s = *viter;
</PRE>

<P>

<h2>Named Parameters</h2>




<H2>The Property Map Parameters</H2>

<P>
Much of the flexibility of BGL comes from property
maps, so this deserves some discussion. As the name implies, a
property map provides a mechanism for reading and writing to
properties that are attached to vertices or edges of a graph.
<I>internal</I> properties are stored inside of a graph object
while <I>external</I> properties are not. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00823100000000000000">
Internal Properties</A>
</H3>

<P>
Property maps for internal properties are always obtained via the
interface defined in <a href="./PropertyGraph.html">PropertyGraph</a>.
This interface defines a traits class <TT>property_map</TT> and a
function <TT>get(property, g)</TT> which returns a property map
object.  The traits classes are used to obtain the <I>type</I> of the
property map given some graph type and a property tag. The
property tag determines which property will be accessed (more than one
property can be attached to the vertices or edges of the graph). The
functions are used to obtain the property map <I>objects</I>.
The following code snippet shows how to create a property map for
the distance and weight properties of graph <TT>G</TT>.

<P>
<PRE>
  boost::property_map&lt;Graph, vertex_distance_t&gt;::type
    d = get(vertex_distance, G);

  boost::property_map&lt;Graph, edge_weight_t&gt;::type
    w = get(edge_weight, G);
</PRE>

<P>
The  BGL graph classes all have <TT>VertexProperty</TT> and
<TT>EdgeProperty</TT> template parameters that let the user specify
internal properties. If the graph <TT>G</TT> has properties for all four of
the properties needed by Dijksta's algorithm, then we could invoke the
algorithm in the following way.

<P>
<PRE>
  boost::dijkstra_shortest_paths(G, s, 
                                 distance_map(get(vertex_distance, G)),
                                 weight_map(get(edge_weight, G)),
                                 color_map(get(vertex_color, G)),
                                 vertex_index_map(get(vertex_index, G)),
                                 null_visitor());
</PRE>

<P>
Since it is somewhat cumbersome to provide arguments for all of the
properties needed by an algorithm,  BGL also provides variants of the
algorithm (shortcuts) that assume that some or all of the properties
are internal to the graph. The following call invokes variant (1) of
Dijkstra's algorithm.

<P>
<PRE>
  boost::dijkstra_shortest_paths(G, s);
</PRE>

<P>

<H3>External Properties</H3>

<P>
There are at least two kinds of situations when internal properties
can not or should not be used, and an external property should be used
instead. The first situation is when a property is only needed for a
short time relative to the lifetime of the graph (perhaps only for the
duration of a single algorithm call). In this case it is more
efficient to keep the property storage in memory for only the time
that it is needed. The second situation is when the properties are
already stored somewhere else due to some pragmatic or historical
reason (yes, programs can and do have histories!).

<P>
For the most part, it is up to the user to create the appropriate
property map for their extrnal properties. A typical property
map class requires only a few lines of code, so this is not
difficult to do.

<P>
BGL does provide one builtin external property map, the
<TT>random_access_iterator_property_map</TT>
which provides a convient way to wrap up a random access iterator for
use as a property map. This adaptor uses the vertex or edge ID
property as an index with the random access iterator. Normal builtin
arrays and pointers to arrays are examples of storage that naturally
have random access iterators. Many of the BGL examples use arrays for
property storage because they are fast and convenient.

<P>
For the <TT>adjacency_list</TT> with template parameter
<TT>VertexList=vecS</TT> the random access iterator adaptor is not
necessary and the random access iterators can be passed as-is into the
algorithm. This is because the vertex descriptors of those classes
<I>are</I> vertex ID's.

<P>

<H2>The Visitor Parameter</H2>

<P>
The visitor parameter gives the user the oportunity to insert their
own operations into the graph algorithm, similar to the function
objects used in the STL. How to use visitors is described in
Section <A HREF="./visitor_concepts.html">Visitor Concepts</A>.
