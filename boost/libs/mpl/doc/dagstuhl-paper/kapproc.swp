Evaluation of SWP
-----------------
Scientific Word/Workplace is a program that makes writing a
LaTeX document easy, even if the author knows nothing about
TeX or LaTeX. (Scientific Word and Scientific Workplace differ
only in that the Maple Math software is included in Scientific
Workplace. We will refer to both programs with the abbreviation
`SWP'.)

SWP is essentially a word and math processor
in which the author enters text and clickable tags and the program
compiles and produces a valid LaTeX file.
This means that the author can be almost completely
ignorant of TeX commands and syntax and yet produce a perfectly
acceptable .tex file.

In addition there are a number of other features that make this
package attractive to authors: ScientificWorkplace includes the
Maple math software so that within one's document calculations
may be done and mathematical graphs may be constructed that will
be printable in the final LaTeX document.

There is downtime necessary to get accustomed to the software and
some set-up time needed to get SWP to work with the Kluwer
kapproc.cls file, but some authors may feel that this is more than
compensated for by ease of use of the program and ease of entry
of mathematical symbols and notation. For those authors who
want to use kapproc.cls with SWP, the following information is necessary.

Getting kapproc.cls to work with SWP
------------------------------------

Here are the names of the files that are necessary to use
when formatting your book with SWP using the kapproc files.

Concise explanation of how to use kapproc.cls with SWP
   kapproc.swp (this file)

Basic kapproc macro file, identical to that used outside of SWP.
   kapproc.cls        

Shell files used by SWP:
   procdocs.shl   
   procsamp.shl
   procbook.shl

SWP compatible versions of the procsamp.tex and procdocs.tex files:
   procsamp.sav
   procdocs.sav


Step 1:
=======
Drop these files into appropriate directories:

Drop these files into directory \swp30\shells\books 
   procdocs.shl   
   procsamp.shl
   procbook.shl

Drop these files into directory \swp30\tcitex\texLaTeX\tci 
   kapproc.cls
   procsamp.sav
   procdocs.sav

Step 2: Setting Defaults in SWP
===============================
Start Scientific Workplace, then


In the File menu, click New
When the New window pops up, 
   under Shell Directories: highlight Books
   under Shell Files: highlight procbook
   Click OK

In the Tools menu, click User Setup
   under Start-up Document
        under Shell Directories: highlight Books
        under Shell Files: highlight procbook
   Click OK

   under Files
       near bottom of window you will see `Default Document Types'
         In the Open Type: bring up-- LaTeX(*.tex)  
         In the Save As Type: bring up-- Portable LaTeX(*.tex)  
   Click OK

Step 3: Viewing and/or Printing Sample Pages
============================================

To see kapproc sample pages followed by verbatim marked up text that
produced the pages, showing the commands that were needed:

Under File, select New

   When the New window pops up, 
     under Shell Directories: highlight Books
     under Shell Files: highlight procsamp
   Click OK

Either:
Click the third button from the far right of the menu to Typeset
this document to print the sample pages

or,
Click the second button from the far right of the menu to Preview
this document to view the sample pages


Step 4: Viewing and/or Printing kapproc Documentation
=====================================================

To see Kluwer Documentation for Proceedings done with the 
kapproc.cls style:


Under File, select New

   When the New window pops up, 
     under Shell Directories: highlight Books
     under Shell Files: highlight procdocs
   Click OK

Either:
Click the third button from the far right of the menu to Typeset
this document to print the documentation.

or,
Click the second button from the far right of the menu to Preview
this document to view the documentation.


Notes on Documentation
----------------------

You will see references in the documentation to both font
issues and the use of the template file. Neither of these
comments applies to your document in SWP. You can see the
commands you need to enter by looking at the Preview or
typeset version of procsamp, as noted above. You will have
to enter these commands without the help of a template file.
Font issues are discussed below. 

Starting Your Book
==================
To start your document,


In the File menu, click New
When the New window pops up, 
   under Shell Directories: highlight Books
   under Shell Files: highlight procbook
   Click OK

Use `Save as' under the File menu, to give this file the name you want.

Entering TeX Commands
=======================
Although you can pick many commands from the Tag menu and
thus don't have to type them in, there are some commands
that are included in the kapproc.cls file that are not
found on that menu. In addition there may be other circumstances
in which you would like to enter a LaTeX command, i.e., 
\setcounter{page}{<number>}. 

In SWP, you are not
allowed to simply type LaTeX commands into your file. However,
you can highlight the Insert menu, go down to the bottom of it,
highlight `fields' and then go to `TeX'. A screen will pop up,
into which you can write any LaTeX command that you'd like to
have in your file. Click on `ok' and the screen will disappear
leaving a grey box on the screen saying `TeX field'. When you
run `preview' from the file menu, whatever was in the `TeX field'
will be expanded and will appear in your file.

Fonts
=====
If you follow the directions above, your book will be typeset using
ComputerModern fonts.

If you would like to use PostScript fonts, which will give your book
a somewhat more finished appearance, you should run LaTeX your files
using LaTeX outside of ScientificWord/Workplace. Fortunately, when
using SWP, you can save your files in a form that will be understood
by any standard LaTeX system.

To rerun your file produced with SWP, you need to do two things:

-- Edit the procps.sty file to have it match the names of the PS fonts
   for Times, Helvetica, and Courier on the system that you are using.

-- You will find the .tex file you have produced while working with
   SWP in the \swp30\docs directory. Edit this file to add the line 
   \usepackage{procps}:

   \documentclass{kapproc}
   \usepackage{procps}


This file is then ready to run with LaTeX outside of SWP in order
to produce your book with PS fonts.
