</h3>
<p>
Because the language does not provide a way to declare a [class] template with variable number of template parameters, any metaprogramming library that appears to give its users a variadic interface to any of its components is in fact emulating these variable-length template parameter lists using default template arguments (14.1 [temp.param] para 9) and a certain amount of code repetition (either manual, or automated by using external tools/standard C preprocessor). Because any static code repetition is finite, these libraries are inevitably limited in the size of template parameter lists they can handle without resorting to less intuitive/idiomatic interfaces. As one might expect, <code>boost::mpl</code> library is not an exception here, although in practice the approach it takes is flexible enough to make this limitedness a non-issue.

<h3>Number of recursively nested template instantiations
</h3>

Appendix B ("Implementation quantities") of the ISO C++ Standard recommends the number 17 as the minimum for the <em>recursively nested template instantiations</em> quantity. Basically, it means that ??
