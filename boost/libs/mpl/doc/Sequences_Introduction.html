<h1><a href="./Table_of_Content.html"><img src="./mpl_logo.jpg" alt="[Home]" border=0 align="right"></a>Sequences Introduction</h1>A possibility to represent and manipulate theoreticaly unbounded sequences of types and values at compile time opens an exciting opportunities for creating highly reusable, configurable, and amazingly easy-to-use generic components and classes [<a href="./Bibliography.html">Czarnecki</a>], [<a href="./Bibliography.html">Alexandrescu</a>]. In some people's opinion, compile-time-operable collections of types (and, to a slightly less extent, values) are at least as important in generic and template metaprogramming as their run-time equivalents in traditional programming. The <em>boost::mpl</em> library acknowledges this assertion by providing an STL-like framework of sequence, algorithm and function classes that can significantly simplify building of complex generic/generative components/systems.
