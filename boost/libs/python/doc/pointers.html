<h2><a name="problem">The Problem With Pointers</a></h2>

      <p>
In general, raw pointers passed to or returned from functions are problematic
for Boost.Python because pointers have too many potential meanings. Is it an iterator?
A pointer to a single element? An array? When used as a return value, is the
caller expected to manage (delete) the pointed-to object or is the pointer
really just a reference? If the latter, what happens to Python references to the
referent when some C++ code deletes it?
<p>
There are a few cases in which pointers are converted automatically:
<ul>

<li>Both const- and non-const pointers to wrapped class instances can be passed
<i>to</i> C++ functions. 

<li>Values of type <code>const char*</code> are interpreted as
null-terminated 'C' strings and when passed to or returned from C++ functions are
converted from/to Python strings.

</ul>

<h3>Can you avoid the problem?</h3>

<p>My first piece of advice to anyone with a case not covered above is
``find a way to avoid the problem.'' For example, if you have just one
or two functions that return a pointer to an individual <code>const
T</code>, and <code>T</code> is a wrapped class, you may be able to write a ``thin
converting wrapper'' over those two functions as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
const Foo* f(); // original function
const Foo& f_wrapper() { return *f(); }
  ...
my_module.def(f_wrapper, "f");
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Foo must have a public copy constructor for this technique to work, since Boost.Python
converts <code>const T&</code> values <code>to_python</code> by copying the <code>T</code>
value into a new extension instance.

<h2>Dealing with the problem</h2>

<p>The first step in handling the remaining cases is to figure out what the pointer
means. Several potential solutions are provided in the examples that follow:

<h3>Returning a pointer to a wrapped type</h3>

<h4>Returning a const pointer</h4>

<p>If you have lots of functions returning a <code>const T*</code> for some
wrapped <code>T</code>, you may want to provide an automatic
<code>to_python</code> conversion function so you don't have to write lots of
thin wrappers. You can do this simply as follows:

<blockquote><pre>
BOOST_PYTHON_BEGIN_CONVERSION_NAMESPACE // this is a gcc 2.95.2 bug workaround
  PyObject* to_python(const Foo* p) {
     return to_python(*p); // convert const Foo* in terms of const Foo&
  }
BOOST_PYTHON_END_CONVERSION_NAMESPACE
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>If you can't (afford to) copy the referent, or the pointer is non-const</h4>

<p>If the wrapped type doesn't have a public copy constructor, if copying is
<i>extremely</i> costly (remember, we're dealing with Python here), or if the
pointer is non-const and you really need to be able to modify the referent from
Python, you can use the following dangerous trick. Why dangerous? Because python
can not control the lifetime of the referent, so it may be destroyed by your C++
code before the last Python reference to it disappears:

<blockquote><pre>
BOOST_PYTHON_BEGIN_CONVERSION_NAMESPACE // this is a gcc 2.95.2 bug workaround
  PyObject* to_python(Foo* p)
  {
      return boost::python::python_extension_class_converters&ltFoo&gt::ptr_to_python(p);
  }

  PyObject* to_python(const Foo* p)
  {
      return to_python(const_cast&lt;Foo*&gt;(p));
  }
BOOST_PYTHON_END_CONVERSION_NAMESPACE
</pre></blockquote>

This will cause the Foo* to be treated as though it were an owning smart
pointer, even though it's not. Be sure you don't use the reference for anything
from Python once the pointer becomes invalid, though. Don't worry too much about
the <code>const_cast&lt;&gt;</code> above: Const-correctness is completely lost
to Python anyway!

<h3>[In/]Out Parameters and Immutable Types</h3>

<p>If you have an interface that uses non-const pointers (or references) as
in/out parameters to types which in Python are immutable (e.g. int, string),
there simply is <i>no way</i> to get the same interface in Python. You must
resort to transforming your interface with simple thin wrappers as shown below:
<blockquote><pre>
const void f(int* in_out_x); // original function
const int f_wrapper(int in_x) { f(in_x); return in_x; }
  ...
my_module.def(f_wrapper, "f");
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Of course, [in/]out parameters commonly occur only when there is already a
return value. You can handle this case by returning a Python tuple:
<blockquote><pre>
typedef unsigned ErrorCode;
const char* f(int* in_out_x); // original function
 ...
#include &lt;boost/python/objects.hpp&gt;
const boost::python::tuple f_wrapper(int in_x) { 
  const char* s = f(in_x); 
  return boost::python::tuple(s, in_x);
}
  ...
my_module.def(f_wrapper, "f");
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Now, in Python:
<blockquote><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; str,out_x = f(3)
</pre></blockquote>
