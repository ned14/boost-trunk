        Comparisons with
        Other Systems
      </h1>
      
      <h2>CXX</h2>
      <p>
        Like Boost.Python, <a href="http://cxx.sourceforge.net/">CXX</a> attempts to
        provide a C++-oriented interface to Python. In most cases, as with the
        boost library, it relieves the user from worrying about
        reference-counts. Both libraries automatically convert thrown C++
        exceptions into Python exceptions. As far as I can tell, CXX has no
        support for subclassing C++ extension types in Python. An even
        more significant difference is that a user's C++ code is still basically
        ``dealing with Python objects'', though they are wrapped in
        C++ classes. This means such jobs as argument parsing and conversion are
        still left to be done explicitly by the user.

     <p>
        CXX claims to interoperate well with the C++ Standard Library
        (a.k.a. STL) by providing iterators into Python Lists and Dictionaries,
        but the claim is unfortunately unsupportable. The problem is that in
        general, access to Python sequence and mapping elements through
        iterators requires the use of proxy objects as the return value of
        iterator dereference operations. This usage conflicts with the basic
        ForwardIterator requirements in <a
        href="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/open/n2356/lib-iterators.html#lib.forward.iterators">
        section 24.1.3 of the standard</a> (dereferencing must produce a
        reference). Although you may be able to use these iterators with some
        operations in some standard library implementations, it is neither
        guaranteed to work nor portable.

      <p>
        As far as I can tell, CXX enables one to write what is essentially
        idiomatic Python code in C++, manipulating Python objects through the
        same fully-generic interfaces we use in Python. While you're hardly
        programming directly to the ``bare metal'' with CXX, it basically
        presents a ``C++-ized'' version of the Python 'C' API. Some fraction of
        that capability is available in Boost.Python through <tt><a
        href="../../../boost/python/objects.hpp">boost/python/objects.hpp</a></tt>,
        which provides C++ objects corresponding to Python lists, tuples,
        strings, and dictionaries, and through <tt><a
        href="../../../boost/python/callback.hpp">boost/python/callback.hpp</a></tt>,
        which allows you to call back into python with C++ arguments.

      <p>
        <a href="mailto:dubois1@llnl.gov">Paul F. Dubois</a>, the original
        author of CXX, has told me that what I've described is only half of the
        picture with CXX, but I never understood his explanation well-enough to
        fill in the other half. Here is his response to the commentary above:

<blockquote>
``My intention with CXX was not to do what you are doing. It was to enable a
person to write an extension directly in C++ rather than C. I figured others had
the wrapping business covered. I thought maybe CXX would provide an easier
target language for those making wrappers, but I never explored
that.''<br><i>-<a href="mailto:dubois1@llnl.gov">Paul Dubois</a></i>
</blockquote>

      <h2>SWIG</h2>
      <p>
        <a href= "http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a> is an impressively mature tool
        for exporting an existing ANSI 'C' interface into various scripting
        languages. Swig relies on a parser to read your source code and produce
        additional source code files which can be compiled into a Python (or
        Perl or Tcl) extension module. It has been successfully used to create
        many Python extension modules. Like Boost.Python, SWIG is trying to allow an
        existing interface to be wrapped with little or no change to the
        existing code. The documentation says ``SWIG parses a form of ANSI C
        syntax that has been extended with a number of special directives. As a
        result, interfaces are usually built by grabbing a header file and
        tweaking it a little bit.'' For C++ interfaces, the tweaking has often
        proven to amount to more than just a little bit. One user
        writes:

        <blockquote> ``The problem with swig (when I used it) is that it
        couldnt handle templates, didnt do func overloading properly etc.  For
        ANSI C libraries this was fine.  But for usual C++ code this was a
        problem.  Simple things work.  But for anything very complicated (or
        realistic), one had to write code by hand.  I believe Boost.Python doesn't have
        this problem[<a href="#sic">sic</a>]...  IMHO overloaded functions are very important to
        wrap correctly.''<br><i>-Prabhu Ramachandran</i>
        </blockquote>
        
      <p>
        By contrast, Boost.Python doesn't attempt to parse C++ - the problem is simply
        too complex to do correctly. <a name="sic">Technically</a>, one does
        write code by hand to use Boost.Python. The goal, however, has been to make
        that code nearly as simple as listing the names of the classes and
        member functions you want to expose in Python.

      <h2>SIP</h2> 
      <p>
        <a
        href="http://www.thekompany.com/projects/pykde/background.php3?dhtml_ok=1">SIP</a>
        is a system similar to SWIG, though seemingly more
        C++-oriented. The author says that like Boost.Python, SIP supports overriding
        extension class member functions in Python subclasses. It appears to
        have been designed specifically to directly support some features of
        PyQt/PyKDE, which is its primary client. Documentation is almost
        entirely missing at the time of this writing, so a detailed comparison
        is difficult.

      <h2>ILU</h2>
      <p>
        <a
        href="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">ILU</a>
        is a very ambitious project which tries to describe a module's interface
        (types and functions) in terms of an <a
        href="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/2.0b1/manual-html/manual_2.html">Interface
        Specification Language</a> (ISL) so that it can be uniformly interfaced
        to a wide range of computer languages, including Common Lisp, C++, C,
        Modula-3, and Python. ILU can parse the ISL to generate a C++ language
        header file describing the interface, of which the user is expected to
        provide an implementation. Unlike Boost.Python, this means that the system
        imposes implementation details on your C++ code at the deepest level. It
        is worth noting that some of the C++ names generated by ILU are supposed
        to be reserved to the C++ implementation. It is unclear from the
        documentation whether ILU supports overriding C++ virtual functions in Python.
        
      <h2>GRAD</h2>
      <p>
      <a
      href="http://www.python.org/workshops/1996-11/papers/GRAD/html/GRADcover.html">GRAD</a>
      is another very ambitious project aimed at generating Python wrappers for
      interfaces written in ``legacy languages'', among which C++ is the first one
      implemented. Like SWIG, it aims to parse source code and automatically
      generate wrappers, though it appears to take a more sophisticated approach
      to parsing in general and C++ in particular, so it should do a much better
      job with C++. It appears to support function overloading. The
      documentation is missing a lot of information I'd like to see, so it is
      difficult to give an accurate and fair assessment. I am left with the
      following questions:
<ul>
<li>Does it support overriding of virtual functions?
<li>What about overriding private or protected virtual functions (the documentation indicates
that only public interfaces are supported)?
<li>Which C++ language constructs are supportd?
<li>Does it support implicit conversions between wrapped C++ classes that have
an inheritance relationship?
<li>Does it support smart pointers?
</ul>
      <p>
        Anyone in the possession of the answers to these questions will earn my
        gratitude for a write-up <code>;-)</code>

      <h2>Zope ExtensionClasses</h2>
      <p>
         <a href="http:http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass">
        ExtensionClasses in Zope</a> use the same underlying mechanism as Boost.Python
        to support subclassing of extension types in Python, including
        multiple-inheritance. Both systems support pickling/unpickling of
        extension class instances in very similar ways. Both systems rely on the
        same ``<a
        href="http://www.python.org/workshops/1994-11/BuiltInClasses/Welcome.html">Don
        Beaudry Hack</a>'' that also inspired Don's MESS System.
      <p>
        The major differences are:
      <ul>
        <li>Zope is entirely 'C' language-based. It doesn't require a C++
        compiler, so it's much more portable than Boost.Python, which stresses
        the limits of even some modern C++ implementations.

        <li>
          Boost.Python lifts the burden on the user to parse and convert function
          argument types. Zope provides no such facility.
        <li>
          Boost.Python lifts the burden on the user to maintain Python
          reference-counts.
        <li>
          Boost.Python supports function overloading; Zope does not.
        <li>
          Boost.Python supplies a simple mechanism for exposing read-only and
          read/write access to data members of the wrapped C++ type as Python
          attributes.
        <li>
          Writing a Zope ExtensionClass is significantly more complex than
          exposing a C++ class to python using Boost.Python (mostly a summary of the
          previous 4 items). <a href= 
          "http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass/MultiMapping.html">A
          Zope Example</a> illustrates the differences.
        <li>
          Zope's ExtensionClasses are specifically motivated by ``the need for a
          C-based persistence mechanism''. Boost.Python's are motivated by the desire
          to simply reflect a C++ API into Python with as little modification as
          possible.
        <li>
          The following Zope restriction does not apply to Boost.Python: ``At most one
          base extension direct or indirect super class may define C data
          members. If an extension subclass inherits from multiple base
          extension classes, then all but one must be mix-in classes that
          provide extension methods but no data.''
        <li>
          Zope requires use of the somewhat funky inheritedAttribute (search for
          ``inheritedAttribute'' on <a
          href="http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass">this page</a>)
          method to access base class methods. In Boost.Python, base class methods can
          be accessed in the usual way by writing
          ``<code>BaseClass.method</code>''.
        <li>
          Zope supplies some creative but esoteric idioms such as <a href= 
          "http://www.digicool.com/releases/ExtensionClass/Acquisition.html">
          Acquisition</a>. No specific support for this is built into Boost.Python.
        <li>
          Zope's ComputedAttribute support is designed to be used from Python.
          <a href="special.html#getter_setter">The analogous feature of
          Boost.Python</a> can be used from C++ or Python. The feature is arguably
          easier to use in Boost.Python.
      </ul>
