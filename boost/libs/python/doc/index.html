    </h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>
      Use the Boost Python Library to quickly and easily export a C++ library to <a
      href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> such that the Python interface is
      very similar to the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally
      intrusive on your C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter
      your C++ classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python. The system
      <em>should</em> simply ``reflect'' your C++ classes and functions into
      Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
<ul>
<li><a href="inheritance.html">Subclassing extension types in Python</a>
<li><a href="overriding.html">Overriding virtual functions in Python</a>
<li><a href="overloading.html">[Member] function Overloading</a>
<li><a href="special.html#numeric_auto">Automatic wrapping of numeric operators</a>
</ul>
among others.


<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>Boost.Python is known to have been tested in the following configurations:

<ul>
<li>Against Python 2.0 using the following compiler/library combinations:
<ul>
  <li><a
  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/vs6sp4/dnldoverview.asp">MSVC++6sp4</a>
  with the native library.

  <li>An upcoming release of <a
        href="http://www.metrowerks.com/products/windows/">Metrowerks
        CodeWarrior Pro6 for Windows</a> with the native library (the first
        release has a bug that's fatal to Boost.Python)

        <li><a
        href="http://developer.intel.com/software/products/compilers/c50/">Intel
        C++ 5.0</a>. Compilation succeeds, but tests <font
        color="#FF0000"><b>FAILED at runtime</b></font> due to a bug in its
        exception-handling implementation.
</ul>

<li>Against Python 1.5.2 using the following compiler/library: 

  <ul>
  <li><a
  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/vs6sp4/dnldoverview.asp">MSVC++6sp4</a> 

  <li><a
  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/vs6sp4/dnldoverview.asp">MSVC++6sp4</a>/<a
  href="http://www.stlport.org">STLport 4.0</a> 

  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC 2.95.2</a> [by <a href="mailto:koethe@informatik.uni-hamburg.de">Ullrich
  Koethe</a>]

  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC 2.95.2</a>/<a href="http://www.stlport.org">STLport 4.0</a>

  <li>Compaq C++ V6.2-024 for Digital UNIX V5.0 Rev. 910 (an <a
  href="http://www.edg.com/">EDG</a>-based compiler) with <a
  href="http://www.stlport.org/beta.html">STLport-4.1b3</a> [by <a
  href="mailto:rwgk@cci.lbl.gov">Ralf W. Grosse-Kunstleve</a>] 

  <li>An upcoming release of <a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/products/windows/">Metrowerks CodeWarrior
        Pro6 for Windows</a> (the first release has a bug that's fatal to Boost.Python)
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Credits</h2>
<ul>
      <li><a href="../../../people/dave_abrahams.htm">David Abrahams</a> originated
      and wrote most of the library, and continues to coordinate development.

      <li><a href="mailto:koethe@informatik.uni-hamburg.de">Ullrich Koethe</a>
      had independently developed a similar system. When he discovered Boost.Python,
      he generously contributed countless hours of coding and much insight into
      improving it. He is responsible for an early version of the support for <a
      href="overloading.html">function overloading</a> and wrote the support for
      <a href="inheritance.html#implicit_conversion">reflecting C++ inheritance
      relationships</a>. He has helped to improve error-reporting from both
      Python and C++, and has designed an extremely easy-to-use way of 
      exposing <a href="special.html#numeric">numeric operators</a>, including
      a way to avoid explicit coercion by means of overloading.
      
      <li><a href="http://cci.lbl.gov/staff/ralf_grosse-kunstleve.html">Ralf W.
      Grosse-Kunstleve</a> contributed <a href="pickle.html">pickle support</a>
      and numerous other small improvements. He's working on a way to allow
      types exported by multiple modules to interact.

      <li>The members of the boost mailing list and the Python community
      supplied invaluable early feedback. In particular, Ron Clarke, Mark Evans,
      Anton Gluck, Chuck Ingold, Prabhu Ramachandran, and Barry Scott took the
      brave step of trying to use Boost.Python while it was still in early
      stages of development.

      <li>The development of Boost.Python wouldn't have been possible without
      the generous support of <a href="http://www.dragonsys.com/">Dragon
      Systems/Lernout and Hauspie, Inc</a> who supported its development as an
      open-source project.

      Documentation is a major ongoing project; assistance is greatly
      appreciated! In the meantime, useful examples of every Boost.Python feature should
      be evident in the regression test files <code>test/comprehensive.[<a
