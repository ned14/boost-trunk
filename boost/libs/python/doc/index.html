    </h1>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
    <p>
      Use the Boost Python Library to quickly and easily export a C++ library to <a
      href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> such that the Python interface is
      very similar to the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally
      intrusive on your C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter
      your C++ classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python. The system
      <em>should</em> simply ``reflect'' your C++ classes and functions into
      Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
<ul>
<li><a href="inheritance.html">Subclassing extension types in Python</a>
<li><a href="overriding.html">Overriding virtual functions in Python</a>
<li><a href="overloading.html">[Member] function Overloading</a>
<li><a href="special.html#numeric_auto">Automatic wrapping of numeric operators</a>
</ul>
among others.


<h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>Boost.Python is known to have been tested
against <a href="http://www.python/org/2.2.1">Python 2.2.1</a> using
the following compilers:

<ul>
  <li><a
  href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates/sp/vs6/sp5/default.asp">MSVC++6sp5</a>.
  All tests pass.

  <p>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/">MSVC++7 (Visual
       Studio .NET)</a>. All tests pass.

  <p>
  <li><a href="http://www.metrowerks.com/products/windows/">Metrowerks
        CodeWarrior Pro7.2 and Pro7.0 for Windows</a>. All tests pass.

  <p>
  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC 3.0.4</a> under <a
       href="www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> and
       <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat Linux 7.1</a>.
       All tests pass.

  <p>
  <li>Compaq C++ V6.2-024 for Digital UNIX (an <a
      href="http://www.edg.com/">EDG</a>-based compiler).
      All tests pass.<br>
      Note that the Boost.Compatibility
      library must be included (see e.g. tru64_cxx.mak in the build
      directory).

  <p>
  <li>Silicon Graphics MIPSpro Version 7.3.1.2m (an <a
      href="http://www.edg.com/">EDG</a>-based compiler).
      All tests pass.<br>
      Note that the Boost.Compatibility
      library must be included (see e.g. irix_CC.mak in the build
      directory).

  <p>
  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC 2.95.2</a> under <a
       href="www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> and <a
       href="http://www.redhat.com/">RedHat Linux 7.1</a>.
       Compilation succeeds, but some tests fail at runtime due to
       exception handling bugs. It is therefore highly recommended
       to use GCC 3.0.4 instead.

  <p>
  <li><a
        href="http://developer.intel.com/software/products/compilers/c50/">Intel
        C++ 6.0</a> beta: Comprehensive test fails to link due to a
        linker bug. Other tests seem to work.

  <p>
  <li><a
        href="http://developer.intel.com/software/products/compilers/c50/">Intel
        C++ 5.0</a> Comprehensive test fails at runtime due to an
        exception-handling bug. Other tests seem to work.

</ul>

<p>
Note that pickling doesn't work with Python 2.2
due to a core language bug. This is fixed in
<a href="http://www.python/org/2.2.1">2.2.1</a>.

<p>
Boost.Python has also been used with other versions of Python back to
Python 1.5.2. It is expected that the older Python releases still work,
but we are not regularly testing for backward compatibility.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<ul>
      <li><a href="../../../people/dave_abrahams.htm">David Abrahams</a> originated
      and wrote most of the library, and continues to coordinate development.

      <li><a href="mailto:koethe@informatik.uni-hamburg.de">Ullrich Koethe</a>
      had independently developed a similar system. When he discovered Boost.Python,
      he generously contributed countless hours of coding and much insight into
      improving it. He is responsible for an early version of the support for <a
      href="overloading.html">function overloading</a> and wrote the support for
      <a href="inheritance.html#implicit_conversion">reflecting C++ inheritance
      relationships</a>. He has helped to improve error-reporting from both
      Python and C++, and has designed an extremely easy-to-use way of 
      exposing <a href="special.html#numeric">numeric operators</a>, including
      a way to avoid explicit coercion by means of overloading.
      
      <li><a href="http://cci.lbl.gov/staff/ralf_grosse-kunstleve.html">Ralf W.
      Grosse-Kunstleve</a> contributed <a href="pickle.html">pickle support</a>
      and numerous other small improvements. He's working on a way to allow
      types exported by multiple modules to interact.

      <li>The members of the boost mailing list and the Python community
      supplied invaluable early feedback. In particular, Ron Clarke, Mark Evans,
      Anton Gluck, Chuck Ingold, Prabhu Ramachandran, and Barry Scott took the
      brave step of trying to use Boost.Python while it was still in early
      stages of development.

      <li>The development of Boost.Python wouldn't have been possible without
      the generous support of <a href="http://www.dragonsys.com/">Dragon
      Systems/Lernout and Hauspie, Inc</a> who supported its development as an
      open-source project.
