      A Brief Introduction to writing Python extension modules
    </h1>
    <p>
      Interfacing any language to Python involves building a module which can
      be loaded by the Python interpreter, but which isn't written in Python.
      This is known as an <em>extension module</em>. Many of the <a href= 
      "http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/lib.html">built-in Python
      libraries</a> are constructed in 'C' this way; Python even supplies its
      <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/types.html">fundamental
      types</a> using the same mechanism. An extension module can be statically
      linked with the Python interpreter, but it more commonly resides in a
      shared library or DLL.
    <p>
      As you can see from <a href= 
      "http://www.python.org/doc/current/ext/ext.html"> The Python Extending
      and Embedding Tutorial</a>, writing an extension module normally means
      worrying about
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/ext/refcounts.html">
        maintaining reference counts</a>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/ext/callingPython.html"> how
        to call back into Python</a>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/ext/parseTuple.html">
        function argument parsing and typechecking</a>
    </ul>
    This last item typically occupies a great deal of code in an extension
    module. Remember that Python is a completely dynamic language. A callable
    object receives its arguments in a tuple; it is up to that object to extract
    those arguments from the tuple, check their types, and raise appropriate
    exceptions. There are numerous other tedious details that need to be
    managed; too many to mention here. The Boost Python Library is designed to
    lift most of that burden.<br>
    <br>
     
    <p>
      Another obstacle that most people run into eventually when extending
      Python is that there's no way to make a true Python class in an extension
      module. The typical solution is to create a new Python type in the
      extension module, and then write an additional module in 100% Python. The
      Python module defines a Python class which dispatches to an instance of
      the extension type, which it contains. This allows users to write
      subclasses of the class in the Python module, almost as though they were
      sublcassing the extension type. Aside from being tedious, it's not really
      the same as having a true class, because there's no way for the user to
      override a method of the extension type which is called from the
      extension module. Boost.Python solves this problem by taking advantage of <a
      href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/metaclasses/">Python's metaclass
      feature</a> to provide objects which look, walk, and hiss almost exactly
      like regular Python classes. Boost.Python classes are actually cleaner than
      Python classes in some subtle ways; a more detailed discussion will
      follow (someday).</p>
