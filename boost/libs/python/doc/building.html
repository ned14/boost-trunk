      <p>
         Right now, the only supported configuration is one in which the BPL
         source files are statically linked with the source for your extension
         module. You may first build them into a library and link it with your
         extension module source, but the effect is the same as compiling all
         the source files together. Some users have successfully built the
         sources into a shared library, and support for a shared library
         build is planned, but not yet implemented. The BPL source files are:
