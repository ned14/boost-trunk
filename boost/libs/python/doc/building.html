      <p>
         Right now, the only supported configuration is one in which the py_cpp
         source files are statically linked with the source for your extension
         module. You may first build them into a library and link it with your
         extension module source, but the effect is the same as compiling all
         the source files together. Some users have successfully built the
         py_cpp sources into a shared library, and support for a shared library
         build is planned, but not yet implemented. The py_cpp source files are:
<blockquote>
<pre>
<a href="../../../libs/python/src/extension_class.cpp">extclass.cpp</a>
<a href="../../../libs/python/src/functions.cpp">functions.cpp</a>
<a href="../../../libs/python/src/init_function.cpp">init_function.cpp</a>
<a href="../../../libs/python/src/module_builder.cpp">module.cpp</a>
<a href="../../../libs/python/src/types.cpp">newtypes.cpp</a>
<a href="../../../libs/python/src/objects.cpp">objects.cpp</a>
<a href="../../../libs/python/src/conversions.cpp">py.cpp</a>
<a href="../../../libs/python/src/classes.cpp">subclass.cpp</a>
         </pre>
