Added a more generic (but ugly) code to declare the smart pointer converters.

07 Apr 2003
- Removed the warnings about forward declarations: it was not accurate enough.
  Another strategy must be thought of.
- Fixed bug in the --multiple mode, where the order of the class instantiations
  could end up wrong.
- Lots of fixes in the documentation, pointed out by Dirk Gerrits. Thanks Dirk!
- Fixed support for the return_opaque_pointer policy (the support macro was not
  being declared).
