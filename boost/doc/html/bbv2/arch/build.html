<p>The build layer has just four main parts -- metatargets (abstract targets),
        virtual targets, generators and properties. 
        </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Metatargets (see the "targets.jam" module) represent
              all the user-defined entities which can be built. The "meta" prefix
              signify that they don't really corrspond to files -- depending of
              build request, they can produce different set of
              files. Metatargets are created when Jamfiles are loaded. Each
              metagarget has a <code class="computeroutput">generate</code> method which is given a
              property set and produces virtual targets for the passed properties.
            </p></li>
<li><p>Virtual targets (see the "virtual-targets.jam"
              module) correspond to the atomic things which can be updated --
              most typically files. 
            </p></li>
<li><p>Properties are just (name, value) pairs, specified
              by the user and describing how the targets should be
              built. Properties are stored using the <code class="computeroutput">property-set</code> class.
              </p></li>
<li><p>Generators are the objects which encapsulate tools
              -- they can take a list of source virtual targets and produce new
              virtual targets from them.
            </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>The build process includes those steps:
        </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>Top-level code calls the <code class="computeroutput">generate</code>
              method of a metatarget with some properties.  </p></li>
<li><p>The metatarget combines the requested properties
              with requirements and passes the result, together with the list
              of sources, to the <code class="computeroutput">generators.construct</code>
              function</p></li>
<li><p>A generator appropriate for the build properties is
              selected and its <code class="computeroutput">run</code> method is
              called. The method returns a list of virtual targets
            </p></li>
<li><p>The targets are returned to the top level code. They
              are converted into bjam targets (via
              <code class="computeroutput">virtual-target.actualize</code>) and passed to bjam for building.
            </p></li>
</ol></div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="bbv2.arch.metatargets"></a>Metatargets</h3></div></div></div>
<p>There are several classes derived from "abstract-target". The
          "main-target" class represents top-level main target, the "project-target"
          acts like container for all main targets, and "basic-target" class is a
          base class for all further target types.
        </p>
<p>Since each main target can have several alternatives, all top-level
          target objects are just containers, referring to "real" main target
          classes. The type is that container is "main-target". For example, given:
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
alias a ;
lib a : a.cpp : &lt;toolset&gt;gcc ;
</pre>
<p>
          we would have one-top level instance of "main-target-class", which will
          contain one instance of "alias-target-class" and one instance of
          "lib-target-class". The "generate" method of "main-target" decides
          which of the alternative should be used, and call "generate" on the
          corresponding instance.
        </p>
<p>Each alternative is a instance of a class derived from
          "basic-target". The "basic-target.generate" does several things that are
          always should be done:
          </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>Determines what properties should be used for building the
                target. This includes looking at requested properties, requirements,
                and usage requirements of all sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Builds all sources</p></li>
<li><p>Computes the usage requirements which should be passes back.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
          For the real work of constructing virtual target, a new method
          "construct" is called.
        </p>
<p>The "construct" method can be implemented in any way by classes
          derived from "basic-target", but one specific derived class plays the
          central role -- "typed-target". That class holds the desired type of file
          to be produces, and calls the generators modules to do the job.
        </p>
<p>This means that a specific metatarget subclass may avoid using
          generators at all. However, this is deprecated and we're trying to
          eliminate all such subsclasses at the moment.
        </p>
<p>Note that the <code class="filename">build/targets.jam</code> file contains
            an UML diagram which might help.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="bbv2.arch.virtual"></a>Virtual targets</h3></div></div></div>
<p>Virtual targets correspond to the atomic things which can be
          updated. Each virtual target can be assigned an updating action --
          instance of the <code class="computeroutput">action</code> class. The action class, in
          turn, contains a list of source targets, properties, and a name of
          bjam action block which should be executed.
        </p>
<p>We try hard to never create equal instances of the
          <code class="computeroutput">virtual-target</code> class. Each code which creates virtual
          targets passes them though the <code class="computeroutput">virtual-target.register</code>
          function, which detects if a target with the same name, sources, and
          properties was created. In that case, existing target is returned.
        </p>
<p>When all virtual targets are produced, they are
          "actualized". This means that the real file names are computed, and
          the commands that should be run are generated. This is done by the
          <code class="computeroutput">virtual-target.actualize</code> method and the
          <code class="computeroutput">action.actualize</code> methods. The first is conceptually
          simple, while the second need additional explanation. The commands
          in bjam are generated in two-stage process. First, a rule with the
          appropriate name (for example
          "gcc.compile") is called and is given the names of targets. The rule
          sets some variables, like "OPTIONS". After that, the command string
          is taken, and variable are substitutes, so use of OPTIONS inside the
          command string become the real compile options.
        </p>
<p>Boost.Build added a third stage to simplify things. It's now
          possible to automatically convert properties to appropriate assignments to
          variables. For example, &lt;debug-symbols&gt;on would add "-g" to the
          OPTIONS variable, without requiring to manually add this logic to
          gcc.compile. This functionality is part of the "toolset" module.
        </p>
<p>Note that the <code class="filename">build/virtual-targets.jam</code> file
            contains an UML diagram which might help.</p>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage"></div>
<p>Above, we noted that metatargets are built with a set of
          properties. That set is represented with the
          <code class="computeroutput">property-set</code> class. An important point is that handling
          of property sets can get very expensive. For that reason, we make
          sure that for each set of (name, value) pairs only one
          <code class="computeroutput">property-set</code> instance is created. The
          <code class="computeroutput">property-set</code> uses extensive caching for all operation,
          so most work is avoided. The <code class="computeroutput">property-set.create</code> is the 
          factory function which should be used to create instances of the
          <code class="computeroutput">property-set</code> class.
