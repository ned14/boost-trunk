[section:intro Introduction]

Boost.Jam (BJam)  is a build tool based on FTJam, which in turn is based on 
Perforce Jam. It contains significant improvements made to facilitate its use 
in the Boost Build System, but should be backward compatible with Perforce Jam.

This is version 3.1.12 of BJam and is based on version 2.4 of Jam/MR:

    This is Release 2.4 of Jam/MR, a make-like program.

[section:features Features]

Jam is a make(1) replacement that makes building simple things simple and 
building complicated things manageable.

Jam's language is expressive, making Jamfiles (c.f. Makefiles) compact.

Jam handles header file dependencies automatically and on-the-fly.

Jam is very portable: it runs on UNIX, VMS, Mac, and NT. Most Jamfiles 
themselves are portable.

Jam is unintrusive: it is small, it has negligible CPU overhead, and it 
doesn't create any of its own funny files (c.f. Odin, nmake, SunOS make).

Jam can build large projects spread across many directories in one pass, 
without recursing, tracking the relationships among all files. Jam can do this 
with multiple, concurrent processes.

Jam isn't under the blinkin GNU copyright, so you can incorporate it into 
commercial products.
