    <h1>Boost Build System V2</h1>

    <h2><a name="synopsis">Synopsis</a></h2>

    <p>Boost.Build is a system for large project software construction, which
    is simple to use and powerfull. Boost.Build V2 is an onging project to
    rewrite Boost.Build, improving design and making it more extensible. The
    distinguishing features are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Simple and high level target description language</b>. In most
      cases name of target and list of sources is enough.</li>

      <li><b>Variant builds</b>. You can build with your choice of basic
      variants (e.g. debug, release, profile...), toolsets (e.g. gcc and
      msvc) and specific properties (e.g. inlining off) from a single command
      invocation.</li>

      <li><b>Portability</b>. ``Feature Normalization'' allows to fine-tune
      targets independently from the toolset used, and modular toolset
      descriptions are employed to generate actual build instructions.</li>

      <li><b>Multi-project builds</b>. Several projects can be combined and
      built together, with dependencies correctly tracked. Typically, the
      setting (like include paths and defines) needed to use other project
      will be handled automatically.</li>

      <li><b>Extensibility</b>. New file types and tools can be easily
      added</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>The user manual, which includes installation instructions, tuturial

    <h2><a name="status">Status</a></h2>

    <p>Enough of the core functionality is implemented to allow practical use
    on medium-size projects. Several compilers and tools are supported, the
    full list is available <a href="doc/tools.html">here</a>. <!--
