Milestone 10 ()

Changes in this release:

    Many toolsets were added: Intel, Metrowerks, Comeau, aCC, vacpp.
    Documentation was converted to BoostBook and improved.
    Performance was improved.
 
    - Toolsets initialization syntax is much more uniform. Compiler and linker
      flags can now be specified.
    - The algorithm for computing build properties was improved. Conditional
      requirements can be chained, and a number of bugs were fixed.
    - Specific order of properties can be specified.
    - The main target rules can be called from everywhere, not necessary from
      Jamfile.
    - Check for "unused sources" removed.
    - The <library> feature affects only linking now.
    - The <file> feature now works only for libraries.
    - Simpler syntax for "searched" libraries was added.
    - New <dependency> feature.
    

    Unix: 
        The right order of static libraries on Unix is automatically
        computed. 
        The <hardcode-dll-paths> feature is the default.
    gcc: 
         The -fPIC option is passed when creating shared libraries. 
         Problems with distcc were solved.
    Sun:         
         It's now possible to use the sun linker (as opposed to gnu), and
         to compile C files.
    Darwin:
         Shared libraries are now supported.
    MSVC: Before resource files compilation, the setup script is invoked.
          Options deprecated in 8.0 are not longer used.


The following bugs were fixed:

    - The <unit-test> rule did not handle the <library> property (!!!!!!)
    - Don't add "bin" to the build directory explicitly specified by the user.
    - Allow <include-type> to select staged targets,
      even with <traverse-dependencies>off.
    - Includes for the form '# include <whatever>" did not work.
    - (Qt) Add paths to all dependent libs to uic command
      line, which helps if the UI files uses plugins.
    - Using <toolset-msvc:version>xxx in requirements was broken.
    - Error message printed when target can be found is much more clear.
    - Inline targets in sources of 'stage' did not work.
    - Don't produce 'independent target' warnings on Windows
    - (gcc) The <link-runtime>static did not work.
    - (gcc) Suppress warnings from the 'ar' tool on some systems.
    - (gcc) Don't try to set soname on NT.

Developer visible changes:

    - Generator priorities are gone, explicit overrides are used.
    - 'Active' features were removed
    - Support for VMS paths was added.

Milestone 9.1 (Nov 6, 2003)

The following bugs were fixed:

    - The 'unit-test' rule used to ignore <library> properties.
    - The gcc toolset used to ignore <threading> property.

Milestone 9 (Nov 6, 2003)

Changes in this release

    - Putting library in sources of other library now works even for static
      linking, which makes expressing library->library dependency much
      simpler.
    - Performance was considerably improved.      
    - Regression testing framework now works on windows.
    - The "alias" rule can have usage requirements and passes on usage
      requirements of sources.
    - The "stage" rule can traverse dependencies.
    - Support for "def files" was implemented.
    - Targets paths are now shorter.
    - Darwin toolset was improved.

The following bugs were fixed:

    - It was not possible to specify empty suffix for a target type derived
      from other type.
    - The stage rules used to generate incorrect suffix in some cases.
    - It was possible to load Jamfile twice. 
    - The 'use-project' rule was broken when referring to a child project.
    - Use of composite properties in requirements did not work.

Developer visible changes:

    - New CALC builtin, which considerable improves performance.
    - Source layout was reorganized.
    - Handling of response file was simplified.

this release.

Milestone 8 (Oct 15, 2003)

Changes in this release:
 
    - A regression testing framework was implemented.
    - New <implicit-dependency> feature was added for better handling 
      of dependencies to generated headers.
    - The link-compatibility checks not longer cause projects to be skipped,
      and issue warning, not error, for main targets.    
    - Algorithm for selecting main target alternative was improved.
    - The <dependency> feature was renamed to <use>.
    - Project root constants were made available in project root itself.

The following bugs were fixed:

    - failure to recognize shared libraries with version as such
    - the 'path-constant' rule was mishandling absolute paths on Windows.


Milestone 7 (Sep 11, 2003)

Changes in this release:

    - Performance was improved.
    - Support for Sun and Darwin toolsets was added.    
    - <tag> feature, which changes the name of target depending of build
      variant, was implemented.
    - Old-style targets-ids are no longer supported.
    - New 'glob' rule allows to easily perform wildcard matching in Jamfile.
    - Improve bison/flex support to understand C++.

The following bugs were fixed:

    - bogus error on use of project default-build attribute with several
      main target alternatives.
    - broken toolset inheritance
    - hard error after skipping a target due to incompatible requirements
    - incorrect behaviour of a generator when producing several targets of 
      the same type
    - errors on use of the 'project-root' rule in Jamfile context
    - inability to require specific compiler version for a main target.    
    - incorrect behaviour of "bjam msvc" when msvc is configured with explicit
      version.
