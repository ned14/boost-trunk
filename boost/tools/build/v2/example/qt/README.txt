This directory contains Boost.Build examples for the Qt library
(http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/index.html).

The current examples are:
1. Basic setup -- application with several sources and moccable header.
2. Using of .ui source file.
3. Running .cpp files via the moc tool.

For convenience, there are examples both for 3.* and 4.* version of Qt,
they are mostly identical and differ only in source code.
