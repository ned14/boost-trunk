    <h2>How to use this document</h2>

    <p>If you've just found out about Boost.Build V2 and want to know if it
    will work for you, start with <a href="#sec-tutorial">tutorial</a>. You
    can continue with the <a href="#sec-reference">reference</a>. When you're
    ready to try Boost.Build in practice, go to <a href=
    "#installation">installation</a>.</p>

    <p>If you are about to use Boost.Build on your project, or already using
    it and have a problem, look at the <a href=
    "#sec-reference">reference</a>.</p>

    <p>If you're trying to build a project which uses Boost.Build, look at <a
    href="#installation">installation</a> and then read about <a href=
    "#command_line">command line</a>.</p>

    <p>Finally, if nothing applies to you, write to our mailing list, telling
    what information you'd like to know.</p>

    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    Assuming you're installing Boost.Build from released source distribution,
    the following steps are needed. All paths are given relatively to
    Boost.Build root directory, which is the directory with the document you
    are reading. 

    <ol>
      <li>Go to "jam_src" directory and build Boost.Jam. Two convenient
      scripts are provided, "build.sh" (for Unix systems) and "build.bat"
      (for Windows). Run the appropriate one and Boost.Jam will be built to
      directory <tt>bin.{platform_name}.</tt>. The <a href=
      "../jam_src/index.html">Boost.Jam documentation</a> has more details in
      case you need them.</li>

      <li>
        Place the Boost.Jam binary, called "bjam" or "bjam.exe", somewhere in
        your <tt>PATH</tt>. Go to the root directory of Boost.Build and run
        "bjam --version". You should get 
<pre>
      Boost.Build V2 (Milestone N)
     
</pre>
        (where N is the version you've downloaded).
      </li>

      <li>Configure toolsets to use. Open the <tt>user-config.jam</tt> file
      and follow instructions there to specify what compiles/libraries you
      have and where they are located.</li>

      <li>You should now be able to go to <tt>example/hello</tt>, and run
      <tt>bjam</tt> there. A simple application will be built. You can also
      play with other projects in <tt>example</tt>. 
      <!-- This part should not go into intoduction docs, but we need to place
                                                                                                                       it somewhere. 
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                          <p>It is slighly better way is to copy <tt>new/user-config.jam</tt>
                                                                                                                          into one of the locations where it can be found (given in <a href=
                                                                                                                          "#config_files_location">this table</a>). This prevent you from
                                                                                                                          accidentally overwriting your config when updating.</p> -->
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you use Boost distribution, or Boost CVS, the Boost.Build root is
    located at <tt>$boost_root/tools/build/v2</tt> and the installation steps
    are the same. However, don't skip the bjam rebuilding step, even if you
    have a previous version. CVS version of Boost.Build requires CVS version
    of Boost.Jam.</p>

    <p>When starting a new project which uses Boost.Build, you need to make
    sure that build system can be found. There are two ways.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set enviromnetal variable <tt>BOOST_BUILD_PATH</tt> to the absolute
      path to Boost.Build installation directory.</li>

      <li>
        Create, at the top of your project, a file called
        <tt>boost-build.jam</tt>, with a single line: 
<pre>
boost-build /path/to/boost.build ;
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're trying to use Boost.Build V2 on Boost itself, please note
    that when building Boost, V1 is used by default. You'd have to add
    <tt>--v2</tt> command line option to all "bjam" invocations.</p>

    <h2><a name="sec-tutorial">Tutorial</a></h2>

    <h3 id="hello">Hello, world</h3>
    The simplest project that Boost.Build can construct is stored in
    example/hello directory. The targets are declared in a file called
    <tt>Jamfile</tt>, which contains the following: 
<pre>
   exe hello : hello.cpp ;
</pre>
    Even with this simple setup, you can do some interesting things. First of
    all, running "bjam" would build binary "hello" from hello.cpp, in debug
    version. After that, you can run 
<pre>
    bjam release 
</pre>
    which would create release version of the 'hello' binary. Note that debug
    and release version would be created in different directories, so if you
    want to switch from debug to release version and back, no recompilation
    is needed. Let's extend the example by adding another line to Jamfile: 
<pre>
   exe hello2 : hello.cpp ;
</pre>
    You can now rebuild both debug and release versions: 
<pre>
    bjam debug release
</pre>
    You'll see that two versions of "hello2" binary are linked. Of course,
    hello.cpp won't be recompiled. Now you decide to remove all build
    products. You do that with the following command 
<pre>
   bjam --clean debug release
</pre>
    It's also possible to create or clean only specific targets. Both
    following commands are legal and create or clean only files that
    belonging the the named binary: 
<pre>
   bjam hello2
   bjam --clean hello2
</pre>

    <h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

    <p>Boost.Build attempts to allow building different variants of projects,
    e.g. for debugging and release, or in single and multithreaded mode. In
    order to stay portable, it uses the concept of <em>features</em>, which
    is abstract aspect of build configuration. <em>Property</em> is just a
    (feature,value) pair. For example, there's a feature "debug-symbols",
    which can have a value of "on" or "off". When users asks to build project
    is a particual value, Boost.Build will automatically find the appropriate
    flags to the used compiler.</p>

    <p>The "release" and "debug" in bjam invocation that we've seen are just
    are short form of specifying values of feature "variant". There is a lot
    of builtin features, and it's possible to write something like:</p>
<pre>
   bjam release inlining=off debug-symbols=on
</pre>
    The first command line element specified the value of feature "variant".
    The feature is very common and is therefore special &mdash; it's possible
    to specify only value. Another feature, "inlining" is not special, and
    you should use 
<pre>
   feature-name=feature-value
</pre>
    syntax for it. Complete description of features can be found <a href=
    "#features_properties">here</a>. The set of properties specified in the
    command line constitute <em>build request</em> &mdash; the desired
    properties for requested targets, or for the project in the current
    directory. The actual set of properties used for building is often
    different. For example, when compiling a program you need some include
    paths. It's not reasonable to ask the user to specify those paths with
    each bjam invocation, so must be specified in Jamfile and added to the
    build request. For another example, certain application can only be
    linked in multithreaded mode. To support such situations, every target is
    allowed to specify <em>requirements</em> -- properties that are required
    to its building. Consider this example: 
<pre>
   exe hello 
       : hello.cpp
       : &lt;include&gt;/home/ghost/Work/boost &lt;threading&gt;multi
</pre>
    In this case, when hello is build, the two specified properties will
    always be present. This leads to a question: what if user explictly
    requested single-threading. The answer is that requirement can affect
    build properties only to a certain degree: the requested and actual
    properties must be link-compatible. See <a href=
    "#link_compatibility">link compatibility</a> below. If they are not link
    compatible, the bulding of the target is skipped. Previously, we've added
    "hello2" target. Seems like we have to specify the same requirements for
    it, which results in duplication. But there's a better way. Each project
    (i.e. each Jamfile), can specify a set of attributes, including
    requirements: 
<pre>
   project 
       : requirements &lt;include&gt;/home/ghost/Work/boost &lt;threading&gt;multi 
       ;

   exe hello : hello.cpp ;
   exe hello2 : hello.cpp ;
</pre>
    The effect would be as if we specified this requirement for both "hello"
    and "hello2". 

    <h3 id="hierarchy">Project hierarchy</h3>

    <p>So far we only considered examples with one project (i.e. with one
    Jamfile). Typically, you'd have a lot of projects organized into a tree.
    At the top of the tree there's <em>project root</em>. This is a directory
    which contains, besides Jamfile, a file called "project-root.jam". Each
    other Jamfile has a single parent, which is the Jamfile in the nearest
    parent directory. For example, in the following directory layout:</p>
<pre>
    [top] 
      |
      |-- Jamfile
      |-- project-root.jam
      |
      |-- src
      |    |
      |    |-- Jamfile
      |    \-- app.cpp
      | 
      \-- lib
           |
           |-- lib1
           |    |
           |    |-- Jamfile
                |-- lib1.cpp
</pre>
    project root is at top. Both src/Jamfile and lib/lib1/Jamfile have
    [top]/Jamfile as parent project. Projects inherit all attributes (such as
    requirements) from their parents. When the same attributes are specified
    in the project, they are combined with inherited ones. For example, if
    [top]/Jamfile has 
<pre>
     &lt;include&gt;/home/ghost/local
</pre>
    in requirements, then all other projects will have that in their
    requirements too. Of course, any project can add additional includes.
    More details can be found in the section on <a href=
    "#projects">projects</a>. Projects are not automatically built when their
    parents are built. You should specify this explicitly. In our example,
    [top]/Jamfile might contain: 
<pre>
    build-project src ;
</pre>
    It will cause project in src to be built whenever project in [top] is
    built. However, targets in lib/lib1 will be built only if required. For
    example, there may be 10 targets, and two of them are used by targets in
    src/Jamfile. Then, only those two targets will be built. 

    <h3 id="using_libraries">Using libraries</h3>
    Let's continue the above example and see how src/Jamfile can use
    libraries from lib/lib1. (TODO: need to make this section consistent with
    "examples-v2/libraries". Assume lib/lib1/Jamfile contains: 
<pre>
     lib lib1 : lib1.cpp ;
</pre>
    Then, to use this library in src/Jamfile, we can write: 
<pre>
     exe app : app.cpp ../lib/lib1//lib1 ;
</pre>
    While "app.cpp" is a regular source file, "../lib/lib1//lib1" is a
    reference to another target, here, library "lib1" declared in Jamfile at
    "../lib/lib1". When linking the "app" binary, the needed version of the
    library will be built and linked in. But what is meant by "needed"? For
    example, we can request to build "app" with properties 
<pre>
    &lt;optimization&gt;full &lt;cxxflags&gt;-w-8080
</pre>
    Which properties must be used for "lib1"? The answer is that some
    properties are <em>propagated</em> &mdash; Boost.Build attemps to use
    dependencies with the same value of propagated features. The
    &lt;optimization&gt; feature is propagated, so both "app" and "lib1" will
    be compiled with full optimization. But &lt;cxxflags&gt; feature is not
    propagated: its value will be added as-is to compiler flags for "a.cpp",
    but won't affect "lib1". There is still a couple of problems. First, the
    library probably has some headers which must be used when compiling
    "app.cpp". We could use requirements on "app" to add those includes, but
    then this work will be repeated for all programs which use "lib1". A
    better solution is to modify lib/lib1/Jamfilie in this way: 
<pre>
    project 
        : usage-requirements &lt;include&gt;.
        ;

     lib lib1 : lib1.cpp ;
</pre>
    Usage requirements are requirements which are applied to dependents. In
    this case, &lt;include&gt; will be applied to all targets which use
    "lib1" &mdash; i.e. targets which have "lib1" either in sources or in
    dependency properties. You'd need to specify usage requirements only
    once, and programs which use "lib1" don't have to care about include
    paths any longer. Or course, the path will be interpreted relatively to
    "lib/lib1" and will be adjusted according to the <tt>bjam</tt>s
    invocation directory. For example, if building from project root, the
    final compiler's command line will contain <tt>-Ilib/lib1</tt>. 

    <p>The second problem is that we hardcode the path to library's Jamfile.
    Imagine it's hardcoded in 20 different places and we change the directory
    layout. The solution is to use project ids &mdash; symbolic names, not
    tied to directory layout. First, we assign a project id to Jamfile in
    lib/lib1:</p>
<pre>
    project lib1
        : usage-requirements &lt;include&gt;.
        ;
</pre>
    Second, we use the project id to refer to the library in src/Jamfile: 
<pre>
    exe app : app.cpp /lib1//lib1 ;
</pre>
    The "/lib1//lib1" syntax is used to refer to target "lib1" in project
    with global id "/lib1" (the slash is used to specify global id). This
    way, users of "lib1" do not depend on its location, only on id, which is
    supposedly stable. The only thing left, it to make sure that src/Jamfile
    knows the project id that it uses. We add to [top]/Jamfile the following
    line: 
<pre>
    use-project /lib1 : lib/lib1 ;
</pre>
    Now, all projects can refer to "lib1" using the symbolic name. If the
    library is moved somewhere, only a single line in the top-level Jamfile
    should be changed. 

    <h3 id="library_dependencies">Library dependencies</h3>

    <p>The previous example was simple. Often, there are long chains of
    dependencies between libraries. The main application is a thin wrapper on
    top of library with core logic, which uses library of utility functions,
    which uses boost filesystem library. Expressing these dependencies is
    straightforward:</p>
<pre>
    lib utils : utils.cpp /boost/filesystem//fs ;   
    lib core : core.cpp utils ;
    exe app : app.cpp core ;
</pre>

    <p>So, what's the reason to even mention this case? First, because it's a
    bit more complex that it seems. When using shared linking, libraries are
    build just as written, and everything will work. However, what happens
    with static linking? It's not possible to include another library in
    static library. Boost.Build solves this problem by returning back library
    targets which appear as sources for static libraries. In this case, if
    everything is built statically, the "app" target will link not only
    "core" library, but also "utils" and "/boost/filesystem//fs".</p>

    <p>So, the net result is that the above code will work for both static
    linking and for shared linking.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, you want all applications in some project to link to a
    certain library. Putting the library in sources of all targets is
    possible, but verbose. You can do better by using &lt;library&gt;
    property. For example, if "/boost/filesystem//fs" should be linked to all
    applications in your project, you can add
    &lt;library&gt;/boost/filesystem//fs to requirements of the project, like
    this:</p>
<pre>
    project 
       : requirements &lt;library&gt;/boost/filesystem//fs
       ;   
</pre>

    <h3 id="static_shared">Static and shared libaries</h3>
    While the previous section explained how to create and use libraries, it
    omitted one important detail. Libraries can be either <em>static</em>,
    which means they are included in executable files which use them, or
    <em>shared</em> (a.k.a. <em>dynamic</em>), which are only referred to
    from executables, and must be available at run time. Boost.Build can work
    with both types. By default, all libraries are shared. This is much more
    efficient in build time and space. But the need to install all libraries
    to some location is not always convenient, especially for debug builds.
    Also, if the installed shared library changes, all application which use
    it might start to behave differently. 

    <p>Static libraries do not suffer from these problems, but considerably
    increase the size of application. Before describing static libraries,
    it's reasonable to give another, quite simple approach. If your project
    is built with &lt;hardcode-dll-paths&gt;true property, then the
    application will include the full paths for all shared libraries,
    eliminating the above problems. Unfortunately, you no longer can move
    shared library to a different location, which makes this option suitable
    only for debug builds. Further, only gcc compiler supports this
    option.</p>

    <p>Building a library statically is easy. You'd need to change the value
    of &lt;link&gt; feature from it's deafault value <tt>shared</tt>, to
    <tt>static</tt>. So, to build everything as static libraries, you'd
    say</p>
<pre>
    bjam link=static
</pre>
    on the command line. The linking mode can be fine-tuned on per-target
    basis. 

    <ol>
      <li>
        Suppose your library can be only build statically. This is easily
        achieved using requirements: 
<pre>
    lib l : l.cpp : &lt;link&gt;static ;
   
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        What if library can be both static and shared, but when using it in
        specific executable, you want it static? <a href=
        "#target_reference">Target references</a> are here to help: 
<pre>
    exe important : main.cpp helpers/&lt;link&gt;static ;
   
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>
        What if the library is defined in some other project, which you
        cannot change. But still, you want static linking to that library in
        all cases. You can use target references everywhere: 
<pre>
    exe e1 : e1.cpp /other_project//lib1/&lt;link&gt;static ;
    exe e10 : e10.cpp /other_project//lib1/&lt;link&gt;static ;
   
</pre>
        but that's far from being convenient. Another way is to introduce a
        level of indirection: create a local target, which will refer to
        static version of <tt>lib1</tt>. Here's the solution: 
<pre>
    alias lib1 : /other_project//lib1/&lt;link&gt;static ;
    exe e1 : e1.cpp lib1 ;
    exe e10 : e10.cpp lib1 ;
   
</pre>
        (Note, that the "alias" target type is not yet implemented, but it's
        quite simple to do. I bet it's waiting for you to do it ;-))
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="prebuilt_targets">Prebuilt targets</h3>
    We've just learned how to use libraries which are created by Boost.Build.
    But some libraries are not. At the same time, those libraries can have
    different versions (release and debug, for example), that we should
    select depending on build properties. Prebuilt targets provide a
    mechanism for that. Jamfile in lib/lib2 can contain: 
<pre>
    lib lib2
       : 
       : &lt;file&gt;lib2_release.a &lt;variant&gt;release
       ;

    lib lib2
       : 
       : &lt;file&gt;lib2_debug.a &lt;variant&gt;debug
       ;
</pre>
    This defines two alternatives for target "lib2", and for each one names a
    prebuilt file. Naturally, there are no sources. Instead, the &lt;file&gt;
    feature is used to specify the file name. Which alternative is selected
    depends on properties of dependents. If "app" binary should use "lib2",
    we can write: 
<pre>
    exe app : app.cpp /lib/lib1//lib2 ../lib/lib2//lib2 ;
</pre>
    If we build release version of "app", then it will be linked with
    "lib2_release.a", and debug version will use "lib2_debug.a". Another
    important kind of prebuilt targets are system libraries &mdash; more
    specifically, libraries which are automatically found by the compiler.
    E.g. gcc uses "-l" switch for that. Such libraries should be declared
    almost like regular ones: 
<pre>
    lib zlib : : &lt;name&gt;z ;
</pre>
    We again don't specify any sources, but give a name which should be
    passed to the compiler. In this example, and for gcc compiler, the "-lz"
    option will be added. Paths where library should be searched can also be
    specified: 
<pre>
    lib zlib : : &lt;name&gt;z &lt;search&gt;/opt/lib ;
</pre>
    And, of course, two variants can be used: 
<pre>
    lib zlib : : &lt;name&gt;z &lt;variant&gt;release ;
    lib zlib : : &lt;name&gt;z_d &lt;variant&gt;debug ;
</pre>
    Of course, you'll probably never in your life need debug version of zlib,
    but for other libraries this is quite reasonable. 

    <p>More advanced use of prebuilt target is descibed in <a href=
    "doc/recipes.html#site_config_targets">recipes</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="sec-reference">Reference</a></h2>
    This section will document mostly high-level view of Boost.Build,
    mentioning appropriate modules and rules. The on-line help system must be
    used to obtain low-level documentation (see the <a href=
    "#help_option">help option</a>). 

    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

    <p>The most fundemental entity in Boost.Build is <em>main target</em>.
    This is object that user want to construct from sources and keep up to
    date with regard to those sources. Typical examples of main targets are
    executable files and libraries.</p>

    <p>Main targets are grouped in <em>projects</em>. Their main purpose is
    organization: related targets placed in one project, can then be built
    together, or share some definitions.</p>

    <p>Main targets and projects are created as the result of reading one or
    several Jamfiles. Each Jamfile is a file written in Boost.Jam interpreted
    language, and typically contains calls to functions provided by
    Boost.Build, which create main targets of needed type, declare project
    attributes and access other projects. The full list of functions provided
    by Boost.Build is described <a href="#builtins">below</a>. Of course,
    user can create his own functions, or it can directly access Boost.Build
    internals from Jamfile, if builtin facilities are not sufficient.</p>

    <p>Each main target, or project can be built in a number of ways, say
    with optimization or without. We'll call such entities "metatargets". To
    make Boost.Build produce any real targets, user issues <a href=
    "#build_request">build request</a>, which specifies metatargets to be
    built, and properties to be used.</p>

    <p>The <em>properties</em> are just (name,value) pairs that describe
    various aspects of constructed objects, for example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;optimization&gt;full &lt;inlining&gt;off
</pre>

    <p>Given the built request, Boost.Build figures out the targets needed
    for requested metatargets with requested properties, how they can be
    created, and whether exising files can be reused. It finally issues
    command to create needed files, automatically converting properties into
    appropricate command line options.</p>

    <h3 id="first_project">Your first project and roadmap</h3>

    <p>Creating your first project requires three steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create an empty file called "Jamfile"</li>

      <li>Create an empty file called "project-root.jam"</li>

      <li>
        Either set your <tt>BOOST_BUILD_PATH</tt> environment variant to
        Boost.Build root, or create a "boost-build.jam" file with the
        following content: 
<pre>
boost-build /path/to/boost.build ;
</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>After that, you can run the "bjam" command in the directory where
    you've created the files. Surely, it won't do anything, but it will run
    without error, at least. Your next steps might be:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Adding new main targets to the "Jamfile" file. The basic syntax for
      declaring a main target is described <a href="#main_targets">below</a>,
      and all builtin functions for declaring main targets are <a href=
      "#builtins_main_targets">listed</a>.</li>

      <li>Creating subprojects. Create a directory, put new Jamfile there,
      and move some main targets to that Jamfile, or declare new ones. The <a
      href="#projects">projects reference</a> will help with this part.</li>

      <li>Customizing Boost.Build for your needs. You might have additional
      tools you want to run, or just want different extension for some file.
      The <a href="doc/extending.html">extender manual</a> is waiting for
      you.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="main_targets">Main targets</h3>

    <p id="main_target"><em>Main target</em> is a user-defined named entity
    which can be build, for example a named executable file. Declaring a main
    target is usually done using one of <a href="#builtins_main_targets">main
    target functions</a>. The user can also declare <a href=
    "doc/extending.html#main_target_rules">custom main target
    function</a>.</p>

    <p>Most main targets rules in Boost.Build use similiar syntax:</p>
<pre>
    function-name main-target-name 
        : sources 
        : requirements 
        : default-build 
        : usage-requirements 
        ;
   
</pre>

    <ul>
      <li>"main-target-name" is the name used to request the target on
      command line and to use it from other main targets. Main target name
      may contain alphanumeric characters and symbols '-' and '_';</li>

      <li>"sources" is the list of source files and other main targets that
      must be combined. If source file is specified using relative path, it's
      considered to be relative to the source directory of the project where
      the path is used. See the <a href="#project_rule">project</a> rule for
      information how to change source directory.</li>

      <li>"requirements" is the list of properties that must always be
      present when this main target is built.</li>

      <li>"default-build" is the list of properties that will be used unless
      some other value of the same feature is already specified.</li>

      <li>"usage-requirements" is the list of properties that will be
      propagated to all main targets that use this one, i.e. to all
      dependedents.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some main target rules have shorter list of parameters, and you should
    consult their documentation for details.</p>

    <p>Building of the same main target can differ greatly from platform to
    platform. For example, you might have different list of sources for
    different compilers. Therefore it is possible to invoke main target rules
    several times for a single main target. For example:</p>
<pre>
    exe a : a_gcc.cpp : &lt;toolset&gt;gcc ;
    exe a : a.cpp ;
</pre>
    Each call to the 'exe' rule defines a new <em>main target
    alternative</em> for the main target <tt>a</tt>. In this case, the first
    alternative will be used for the <tt>gcc</tt> toolset, while the second
    alternative will be used in other cases. See <a href=
    "#alternative_selection">below</a> for details. 

    <p>Sometime a main target is really needed only by some other main
    target. E.g. a rule that declared test-suite uses a main target that
    represent test, but those main targets are rarely needed by themself.</p>

    <p>It possible to declare target inline, i.e. the "sources" parameter may
    include call to other main rules. For example:</p>
<pre>
    exe hello : hello.cpp 
       [ obj helpers : helpers.cpp : &lt;optimization&gt;off ] ;
   
</pre>
    Will cause "helpers.cpp" to be always compiled without optimization. It's
    possible to request main targets declared inline, but since they are
    considered local, they are renamed to
    "parent-main-target_name..main-target-name". In the example above, to
    build only helpers, one should run "bjam hello..helpers". 

    <h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>

    <p>Boost.Build considers every software it build as organized into
    <em>projects</em> &mdash; modules which declare targets. Projects are
    organized in a hierarchical structure, so each project may have a single
    parent project and a number of subprojects.</p>

    <p>Most often, projects are created as result of loading <em>Jamfile</em>
    &mdash; files which are specially meant to describe projects. Boost.Build
    will implicitly load Jamfile in the invocation directory, and all
    Jamfiles referred by the first one, creating the hierarchy of
    projects.</p>

    <p>The exact name of file that describes project is configurable. By
    default, it's <tt>Jamfile</tt>, but can be changed by setting global
    variables <tt>JAMFILE</tt>, for example in <tt>boost-build.jam</tt> file.
    The value of the variable is a list of regex patterns that are used when
    searching for Jamfile in a directory.</p>

    <p>Every Boost.Build modules can decide to act as project and be able to
    declare targets. For example, the <tt>site-config.jam</tt> module can
    declare libraries available on a given host, as described <a href=
    "doc/recipes.html#site_config_targets">here</a>.</p>

    <p>There are three things that can be put in Jamfile: declarations of
    main targets, calls to a number of predefined rules, and arbitrary user
    code. The predefined rules are listed below:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Rule</th>

        <th>Semantic</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><a href="#project_rule">project</a></td>

        <td>Define project attributes.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><a href="#use-project_rule">use-project</a></td>

        <td>Make another project known.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><a href="#build-project_rule">build-project</a></td>

        <td>Build another project when this one is built.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><a href="#explicit_rule">explicit</a></td>

        <td>States that the target should be built only by explicit
        request.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>glob</td>

        <td>Takes a list of wildcards, and returns the list of files which
        match any of the wildcards.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Each project is also associated with <em>project root</em>. That's a
    root for a tree of projects, which specifies some global properties.</p>

    <h4>Project root</h4>
    Project root for a projects is the nearest parent directory which
    contains a file called <tt>project-root.jam</tt>. That file defines
    certain properties which apply to all projects under project root. It
    can: 

    <ul>
      <li>configure toolsets, via call to <tt>toolset.using</tt></li>

      <li>refer to other projects, via the <tt>use-project</tt> rule</li>

      <li>declare constants, via the <tt>constant</tt> and
      <tt>path-constant</tt> rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To facilitate declaration of simple projects, Jamfile and project-root
    can be merged together. To achieve this effect, the project root file
    should call the <tt>project</tt> rule. The semantic is precisely the same
    as if the call was made in Jamfile, except that project-root.jam will
    start serve as Jamfile. The Jamfile in the directory of project-root.jam
    will be ignored, and project-root.jam will be able to declare main
    targets as usual.</p>

    <h4>Project attributes</h4>

    <p>For each project, there are several attributes.</p>

    <p><em>Project id</em> is a short way to denote a project, as opposed to
    the Jamfile's pathname. It is a hierarchical path, unrelated to
    filesystem, such as "boost/thread". <a href="#target_id">Target
    references</a> make use of project ids to specify a target.</p>

    <p><em>Source location</em> specifies the directory where sources for the
    project are located.</p>

    <p><em>Project requirements</em> are requirements that apply to all the
    targets in the projects as well as all subprojects.</p>

    <p><em>Default build</em> is the build request that should be used when
    no build request is specified explicitly.</p>

    <p id="project_rule">The default values for those attributes are given in
    the table below. In order to affect them, Jamfile may call the
    <tt>project</tt> rule. The rule has this syntax:</p>
<pre>
    project id : &lt;attributes&gt; ;
   
</pre>
    Here, attributes is a sequence of (attribute-name, attribute-value)
    pairs. The list of attribute names along with its handling is also shown
    in the table below. For example, it it possible to write: 
<pre>
    project tennis 
        : requirements &lt;threading&gt;multi 
        : default-build release
        ;
   
</pre>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Attribute</th>

        <th>Name for the 'project' rule</th>

        <th>Default value</th>

        <th>Handling by the 'project' rule</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Project id</td>

        <td>none</td>

        <td>none</td>

        <td>Assigned from the first parameter of the 'project' rule. It is
        assumed to denote absolute project id.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Source location</td>

        <td><tt>source-location</tt></td>

        <td>The location of jamfile for the project</td>

        <td>Sets to the passed value</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Requirements</td>

        <td><tt>requirements</tt></td>

        <td>The parent's requirements</td>

        <td>The parent's requirements are refined with the passed requirement
        and the result is used as the project requirements.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Default build</td>

        <td><tt>default-build</tt></td>

        <td>none</td>

        <td>Sets to the passed value</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Build directory</td>

        <td><tt>build-dir</tt></td>

        <td>If parent has a build dir set, the value of it, joined with the
        relative path from parent to the current project. Otherwise,
        empty</td>

        <td>Sets to the passed value, interpreted as relative to the
        project's location.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Project relationship</h4>

    <p>There are three kinds of project relationships.</p>

    <p>First is parent-child. This relationship is established implicitly:
    parent directories of a project are searched, and the first found Jamfile
    is assumed to define the parent project. The parent-child relationship
    affects only attribute values for the child project.</p>

    <p id="build-project_rule">Second is build relationship. Some project may
    request to recursively build other projects. Those project need not be
    child projects. The <tt>build-project</tt> rule is used for that:</p>
<pre>
    build-project src ;   
</pre>

    <p id="use-project_rule">The third kind is the 'use' relationship. In
    means that one project uses targets from another. It is possible to just
    refer to target in other projects using target id. However, if target id
    uses project id, it is required that the project id is known. The
    <tt>use-project</tt> rule is employed to guarantee that.</p>
<pre>
    use-project ( id : location )
   
</pre>
    It loads the project at the specified location, which makes its project
    id available in the project which invokes the rule. It is required that
    the <tt>id</tt> parameter passed to the <tt>use-project</tt> rule be
    equal to the id that the loaded project declared. At this moment, the
    <tt>id</tt> paremeter should be absolute project id. 

    <h3 id="target_id">Target identifiers and references</h3>

    <p><em>Target identifier</em> is used to denote a target. The syntax
    is:</p>
<pre>
    target-id -&gt; (project-id | target-name | file-name )
                  | (project-id | directory-name) "//" target-name   
    project-id -&gt; path
    target-name -&gt; path
    file-name -&gt; path
    directory-name -&gt; path                  
</pre>
    This grammar allows some elements to be recognized as either 

    <ul>
      <li>project id (at this point, all project ids start with slash).</li>

      <li>name of target declared in current Jamfile (note that target names
      may include slash).</li>

      <li>a regular file, denoted by absolute name or name relative to
      project's sources location.</li>
    </ul>
    To determine the real meaning a check is made if project-id by the
    specified name exists, and then if main target of that name exists. For
    example, valid target ids might be: 
<pre>
    a                                    -- target in current project
    lib/b.cpp                            -- regular file
    /boost/thread                        -- project "/boost/thread"
    /home/ghost/build/lr_library//parser -- target in specific project
</pre>

    <p><b>Rationale:</b>Target is separated from project by special separator
    (not just slash), because:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>It emphasises that projects and targets are different things.</li>

      <!-- The motivation for which is:
                                                                                    So, to summarize:
                                                                                    1. The project which extract tarfile may extract all possible kinds of 
                                                                                    targets, and it's reasonable to use them directly from other project.
                                                                                    2. The rule for unpacking tar is inplemented in terms of "patch-file", for 
                                                                                    maintainability, and therefore, must use main target name which contains 
                                                                                    slashes?
                                                                                    3. Using sub-Jamfile in "foo" to declare extracted file "foo/b" is not an 
                                                                                    option, because you should not change existing tree 

                                                                                    That makes good rationale for why main target must contain names.
                                                                                     -->

    <h3><a name="features_properties">Features and properties</a></h3>

    <h4><a name="features_defined">Definitions</a></h4>

    <p>A <em>feature</em> is a normalized (toolset-independent) aspect of a
    build configuration, such as whether inlining is enabled. Feature names
    may not contain the '<tt>&gt;</tt>' character.</p>

    <div class="alert">
      And what about dash?
    </div>

    <p>Each feature in a build configuration has one or more associated
    <em>value</em>s. Feature values for non-free features may not contain the
    '<tt>&lt;</tt>', '<tt>:</tt>', or '<tt>=</tt>' characters. Feature values
    for free features may not contain the '<tt>&lt;</tt>' character.</p>

    <p>A <em>property</em> is a (feature,value) pair, expressed as
    &lt;feature&gt;value.</p>

    <p>A <em>subfeature</em> is a feature which only exists in the presence
    of its parent feature, and whose identity can be derived (in the context
    of its parent) from its value. A subfeature's parent can never be another
    subfeature. Thus, features and their subfeatures form a two-level
    hierarchy.</p>

    <p>A <em>value-string</em> for a feature <b>F</b> is a string of the form
    <tt>value-subvalue1-subvalue2</tt>...<tt>-subvalueN</tt>, where
    <tt>value</tt> is a legal value for <b>F</b> and
    <tt>subvalue1</tt>...<tt>subvalueN</tt> are legal values of some of
    <b>F</b>'s subfeatures. For example, the properties
    <tt>&lt;toolset&gt;gcc &lt;toolset-version&gt;3.0.1</tt> can be expressed
    more conscisely using a value-string, as
    <tt>&lt;toolset&gt;gcc-3.0.1</tt>.</p>

    <p>A <em>property set</em> is a set of properties (i.e. a collection
    without dublicates), for instance: <tt>&lt;toolset&gt;gcc
    &lt;runtime-link&gt;static</tt>.</p>

    <p>A <em>property path</em> is a property set whose elements have been
    joined into a single string separated by slashes. A property path
    representation of the previous example would be
    <tt>&lt;toolset&gt;gcc/&lt;runtime-link&gt;static</tt>.</p>

    <p>A <em>build specification</em> is a property set which fully describes
    the set of features used to build a target.</p>

    <h4><a name="property_validity">Property Validity</a></h4>
    For <a href="#free">free</a> features, all values are valid. For all
    other features, the valid values are explicitly specified, and the build
    system will report an error for the use of an invalid feature-value.
    Subproperty validity may be restricted so that certain values are valid
    only in the presence of certain other subproperties. For example, it is
    possible to specify that the <code>&lt;gcc-target&gt;mingw</code>
    property is only valid in the presence of
    <code>&lt;gcc-version&gt;2.95.2</code>. 

    <h4><a name="feature_attributes">Feature Attributes</a></h4>

    <p>Each feature has a collection of zero or more of the following
    attributes. Feature attributes are low-level descriptions of how the
    build system should interpret a feature's values when they appear in a
    build request. We also refer to the attributes of properties, so that a
    <i>incidental</i> property, for example, is one whose feature is has the
    <i>incidental</i> attribute.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>incidental</em> 

        <p>Incidental features are assumed not to affect build products at
        all. As a consequence, the build system may use the same file for
        targets whose build specification differs only in incidental
        features. A feature which controls a compiler's warning level is one
        example of a likely incidental feature.</p>

        <p>Non-incidental features are assumed to affect build products, so
        the files for targets whose build specification differs in
        non-incidental features are placed in different directories as
        described in <a href="#target_paths">target paths</a> below.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>propagated</em> 

        <p id="propagated_features">Features of this kind are propagated to
        dependencies. That is, if a <a href="#main_target">main target</a> is
        built using a propagated property, the build systems attempts to use
        the same property when building any of its dependencies as part of
        that main target. For instance, when an optimized exectuable is
        requested, one usually wants it to be linked with optimized
        libraries. Thus, the <tt>&lt;optimization&gt;</tt> feature is
        propagated.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em><a name="free">free</a></em> 

        <p>Most features have a finite set of allowed values, and can only
        take on a single value from that set in a given build specification.
        Free features, on the other hand, can have several values at a time
        and each value can be an arbitrary string. For example, it is
        possible to have several preprocessor symbols defined
        simultaneously:</p>
<pre>
&lt;define&gt;NDEBUG=1 &lt;define&gt;HAS_CONFIG_H=1
</pre>
        <br>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>optional</em> 

        <p>An optional feature is a feature which is not required to appear
        in a build specification. Every non-optional non-free feature has a
        default value which is used when a value for the feature is not
        otherwise specified, either in a target's requirements or in the
        user's build request. [A feature's default value is given by the
        first value listed in the feature's declaration. -- move this
        elsewhere - dwa]</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>symmetric</em> 

        <p>A symmetric feature's default value is not automatically included
        in <a href="#variants">build variants</a>. Normally a feature only
        generates a subvariant directory when its value differs from the
        value specified by the build variant, leading to an assymmetric
        subvariant directory structure for certain values of the feature. A
        symmetric feature, when relevant to the toolset, always generates a
        corresponding subvariant directory.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>path</em> 

        <p>The value of a path feature specifies a path. The path is treated
        as relative to the directory of Jamfile where path feature is used
        and is translated appropriately by the build system when the build is
        invoked from a different directory</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>implicit</em> 

        <p>Values of implicit features alone identify the feature. For
        example, a user is not required to write "&lt;toolset&gt;gcc", but
        can simply write "gcc". Implicit feature names also don't appear in
        variant paths, although the values do. Thus: bin/gcc/... as opposed
        to bin/toolset-gcc/.... There should typically be only a few such
        features, to avoid possible name clashes.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>composite</em> 

        <p>Composite features actually correspond to groups of properties.
        For example, a build variant is a composite feature. When generating
        targets from a set of build properties, composite features are
        recursively expanded and <em>added</em> to the build property set, so
        rules can find them if neccessary. Non-composite non-free features
        override components of composite features in a build property
        set.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>link-incompatible</em> 

        <p>See <a href="#link_compatibility">below</a>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>dependency</em> 

        <p>The value of dependency feature if a target reference. When used
        for building of a main target, the value of dependency feature is
        treated as additional dependency.</p>

        <p>For example, dependency features allow to state that library A
        depends on library B. As the result, whenever an application will
        link to A, it will also link to B. Specifying B as dependency of A is
        different from adding B to the sources of A. 
        <!-- Need to clarify this. -->
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Features which are neither free nor incidental are called
    <em>base</em> features.</p>

    <p>TODO: document active features..</p>

    <h4><a name="feature_declaration">Feature Declaration</a></h4>
    The low-level feature declaration interface is the <tt>feature</tt> rule
    from the <tt>feature</tt> module: 
<pre>
rule feature ( name : allowed-values * : attributes * )
</pre>
    A feature's allowed-values may be extended wit The build system will
    provide high-level rules which define features in terms of valid and
    useful combinations of attributes. 

    <h3><a name="variants">Build Variants</a></h3>
    A build variant, or (simply variant) is a special kind of composite
    feature which automatically incorporates the default values of features
    that . Typically you'll want at least two separate variants: one for
    debugging, and one for your release code. [ Volodya says: "Yea, we'd need
    to mention that it's a composite feature and describe how they are
    declared, in pacticular that default values of non-optional features are
    incorporated into build variant automagically. Also, do we wan't some
    variant inheritance/extension/templates. I don't remember how it works in
    V1, so can't document this for V2.". Will clean up soon -DWA ] 

    <h4 id="link_compatibility">Link compatible and incompatible
    properties</h4>

    <p>When the build system tries to generate a target (such as library
    dependency) matching a given build request, it may find that an exact
    match isn't possible &mdash; for example, the target may impose additonal
    build requirements. We need to determine whether a buildable version of
    that target can actually be used.</p>

    <p>The build request can originate in many ways: it may come directly
    from the user's command-line, from a dependency of a main target upon a
    library, or from a dependency of a target upon an executable used to
    build that target, for example. For each way, there are different rules
    whether we can use a given subvariant or not. The current rules are
    described below.</p>

    <p>Two property sets are called <em>link-compatible</em> when targets
    with those property sets can be used interchangably. In turn, two
    property sets are link compatible when there's no link-incompatible
    feature which has different values in those property sets.</p>

    <p>When building of a main target is requested from a command line or
    some project, link-compatibility is not considered. When building is
    requested by other main target, via sources or dependency properties, the
    requested and actual property sets must be link-compatible, otherwise a
    warning is produced.</p>

    <p><b>Rationale:</b>Link-compatibility is not considered when main target
    is requested by a project, because it causes problems in practice. For
    example, some parts of a project might be single-threaded, while others
    &mdash; multi-threaded. They are not link-compatible, but they are not
    linked, either. So, there's no need to issue error or warning. The errors
    used to be generated, and only caused problems.</p>

    <h4 id="property_refinement">Definition of property refinement</h4>

    <p>When a target with certain properties is requested, and that target
    requires some set of properties, it is needed to find the set of
    properties to use for building. This process is called <em>property
    refinement</em> and is performed by these rules</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If original properties and required properties are not
      link-compatible, refinement fails.</li>

      <li>Each property in the required set is added to the original property
      set</li>

      <li>If the original property set includes property with a different
      value of non free feature, that property is removed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4 id="conditional_properties">Conditional properties</h4>

    <p>Sometime it's desirable to apply certain requirements only for
    specific combination of other properties. For example, one of compilers
    that you use issues a poinless warning that you want to suppress by
    passing a command line option to it. You would not want to pass that
    option to other compilers. Condititional properties allow to do that.
    Their systax is:</p>
<pre>
  property ( "," property ) * ":" property
</pre>
    For example, the problem above would be solved by: 
<pre>
exe hello : hello.cpp : &lt;toolset&gt;yfc:&lt;cxxflags&gt;-disable-pointless-warning ;
</pre>

    <h3><a name="initialization">Initialization</a></h3>

    <p>bjam's first job upon startup is to load the Jam code which implements
    the build system. To do this, it searches for a file called
    "boost-build.jam", first in the invocation directory, then in its parent
    and so forth up to the filesystem root, and finally in the directories
    specified by the environment variable BOOST_BUILD_PATH. When found, the
    file is interpreted, and should specify the build system location by
    calling the boost-build rule:</p>
<pre>
      rule boost-build ( location ? )
</pre>
    If location is a relative path, it is treated as relative to the
    directory of boost-build.jam. The directory specified by location and
    directories in BOOST_BUILD_PATH are then searched for a file called
    bootstrap.jam which is interpreted and is expected to bootstrap the build
    system. This arrangement allows the build system to work without any
    command-line or environment variable settings. For example, if the build
    system files were located in a directory "build-system/" at your project
    root, you might place a boost-build.jam at the project root containing: 
<pre>
     boost-build build-system ;
</pre>
    In this case, running bjam anywhere in the project tree will
    automatically find the build system. 

    <p>The default "bootstrap.jam", after loading some standard definitions,
    loads two files, which can be provided/customised by user:
    "site-config.jam" and "user-config.jam".</p>

    <p>Locations where those files a search are summarized below:</p>

    <h4 id="command_line_arguments">Command line arguments</h4>
    Command line arguments specify targets and build request using the
    following rules. 

    <ul>
      <li>An argument which does not contain slashes or the "=" symbol is
      either a value of an implicit feature, or target to be built. It is
      taken to be value of a feature if appropriate feature exists.
      Otherwise, it is considered a <a href="#target_id">target id</a>.
      Special target name "clean" has the same effect as "--clean"
      option.</li>

      <li>
        An argument with either slashes or the "=" symbol specifies a number
        of <a href="#build_request">build request</a> elements. In the
        simplest form, it's just a set of properties, separated by slashes,
        which become a single build request element, for example: 
<pre>
borland/&lt;runtime-link&gt;static
</pre>
        More complex form is used to save typing. For example, instead of 
<pre>
borland/runtime-link=static borland/runtime-link=dynamic
</pre>
        one can use 
<pre>
borland/runtime-link=static,dynamic
</pre>
        Exactly, the conversion from argument to build request elements is
        performed by (1) splitting the argument at each slash, (2) converting
        each split part into a set of properties and (3) taking all possible
        combination of the property sets. Each split part should have the
        either the form 
<pre>
    <em>feature-name</em>=<em>feature-value1</em>[","<em>feature-valueN</em>]*   
</pre>
        or, in case of implict feature 
<pre>
    <em>feature-value1</em>[","<em>feature-valueN</em>;]*   
</pre>
        and will be converted into property set 
<pre>
&lt;feature-name&gt;feature-value1 .... &lt;feature-name&gt;feature-valueN
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    For example, the command line 
<pre>
    target1 debug gcc/runtime-link=dynamic,static
   
</pre>
    would cause target called <tt>target1</tt> to be rebuild in debug mode,
    except that for gcc, both dynamically and statically linked binaries
    would be created.

    <h3 id="build_request">Build request</h3>

    <h3><a name="build_process">Build process</a></h3>

    <p>Construction of each main target begins with finding properties for
    <em>this</em> main target. They are found by processing both build
    request, and <em>target requirements</em>, which give properties needed
    for the target to build. For example, a given main target might require
    certian defines, or will not work unless compiled in multithreaded mode.
    The process of finding properties for main target is described in <a
    href="#property_refinement">property refinement</a>.</p>

    <p>After that, dependencies (i.e. other main targets) are build
    recursively. Build request for dependencies is not always equal to those
    of dependent &mdash; certain properties are dropped and user can
    explicitly specify desired properties for dependencies. See <a href=
    "#propagated_features">propagated features</a> and <a href=
    "#target_reference">target reference</a> for details.</p>

    <p>When dependencies are constructed, the dependency graph for this main
    target and for this property set is created, which describes which files
    need to be created, on which other files they depend and what actions are
    needed to construct those files. There's more that one method, and user
    can define new ones, but usually, this involves <em>generators</em> and
    <em>target types</em>.</p>

    <p>Target type is just a way to classify targets. For example, there are
    builtin types <tt>EXE</tt>, <tt>OBJ</tt> and <tt>CPP</tt>. <a href=
    "#generators">Generators</a> are objects that know how to convert between
    different target type. When a target of a given type must be created, all
    generators for that type, which can handle needed properties, are found.
    Each is passed the list of sources, and either fails, or returns a
    dependency graph. If a generator cannot produce desired type from given
    sources, it may try to recursively construct types that it can handle
    from the types is was passed. This allows to try all possible
    transformations. When all generators are tried, a dependency graph is
    selected.</p>

    <p>Finally, the dependency graph is passed to underlying Boost.Jam
    program, which runs all actions needed to bring all main targets up-to
    date. At this step, implicit dependencies are also scanned and accounted
    for, as described <a href="#dependency_scanning">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Given a list of targets ids and a build request, building goes this
    way. First, for each id we obtain the abstract targets corresponding to
    it. This also loads all necessary projects. If no target id is given,
    project in the current directory is used. Build request is expanded, and
    for each resulting property set, the <tt>generate</tt> method of all
    targets is called, which yields a list of virtual targets. After that all
    virtual targets are actualized, and target "all" is set to depend on all
    created actual targets. Lastly, depending on whether <tt>--clean</tt>
    option was given, either target "all" or target "clean" is updated.
    Generation of virtual target from abstract one is performed as
    follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>For project targets, all of main targets are generated with the
        same properties. Then all projects referred via "build-project" are
        generated as well. If it's not possible to refine requested
        properties with project requirements, the project is skipped.</p>

        <p id="explicit_rule">It is possible to disable building of certain
        target using the <tt>explicit</tt> rule, available in all project
        modules. The syntax is</p>
<pre>
    rule explicit ( target-name )
</pre>
        If this rule is invoked on a target, it will be built only when it's
        explicitly requested on the command line.
      </li>

      <li>
        For main target, with several alternatives, one of them is selected
        as described <a href="#alternative_selection">below</a>. If there's
        only one alternative, it's used unconditionally. 

        <ol>
          <li>All main target alternatives which requirements are satisfied
          by the build request are enumerated.</li>

          <li>If there are several such alternatives, the one which longer
          requirements list is selected.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        For the selected alternative 

        <ol>
          <li>Each target reference in the source list are recursively
          constructed.</li>

          <li>Properties are refined with alternative's requirements, and
          active features in the resulting set are executed.</li>

          <li>Conditional properties are evaluated.</li>

          <li>The dependency graph for the target is constructed in a way
          which depends on the kind of main target, typically using
          generators.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>If, when building sources, the properties on recursively created
      targets are not link-compatibile with build properties, a warning is
      issued.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="alternative_selection">Alternative selection</h4>

    <p>When there are several alternatives, one of them must be selected. The
    process is as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>For each alternative <em>condition</em> is defined as the set of
      base properies in requirements. [Note: it might be better to explicitly
      specify the condition explicitly, as in conditional requirements].</li>

      <li>An alternative is viable only if all properties in condition are
      present in build request.</li>

      <li>If there's one viable alternative, it's choosen. Otherwise, an
      attempt is made to find one best alternative. An alternative a is
      better than another alternative b, iff set of properties in b's
      condition is stict subset of the set of properities of 'a's condition.
      If there's one viable alternative, which is better than all other, it's
      selected. Otherwise, an error is reported.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="generated_headers">Generated headers</h3>

    <p>Usually, Boost.Build handles implicit dependendies completely
    automatically. For example, for C++ files, all <tt>#include</tt>
    statements are found and handled. The only aspect where user help might
    be needed is implicit dependency on generated files.</p>

    <p>By default, Boost.Build handles such dependencies within one main
    target. For example, assume that main target "app" has two sources,
    "app.cpp" and "parser.y". The latter source is converted into "parser.c"
    and "parser.h". Then, if "app.cpp" includes "parser.h", Boost.Build will
    detect this dependency. Moreover, since "parser.h" will be generated into
    a build directory, the path to that directory will automatically added to
    include path.</p>

    <p>Making this mechanism work across main target boundaries is possible,
    but imposes certain overhead. For that reason, if there's implicit
    dependency on files from other main targets, the <tt><a href=
    "">&lt;implicit-dependency&gt;</a></tt> feature must be used, for
    example:</p>
<pre>
    lib parser : parser.y ;
    exe app : app.cpp : &lt;implicit-dependency&gt;parser ;
   
</pre>
    The above example tells the build system that when scanning all sources
    of "app" for implicit-dependencies, it should consider targets from
    "parser" as potential dependencies. 

    <h3 id="generators">Generators</h3>

    <p>To construct a main target with given properties from sources, it is
    required to create a dependency graph for that main target, which will
    also include actions to be run. The algorithm for creating the dependency
    graph is described here.</p>

    <p>The fundamental concept is <em>generator</em>. If encapsulates the
    notion of build tool and is capable to converting a set of input targets
    into a set of output targets, with some properties. Generator matches a
    build tool as closely as possible: it works only when the tool can work
    with requested properties (for example, msvc compiler can't work when
    requested toolset is gcc), and should produce exactly the same targets as
    the tool (for example, if Borland's linker produces additional files with
    debug information, generator should also).</p>

    <p>Given a set of generators, the fundamental operation is to construct a
    target of a given type, with given properties, from a set of targets.
    That operation is performed by rule <tt>generators.construct</tt> and the
    used algorithm is described below.</p>

    <h4>Selecting and ranking viable generators</h4>

    <p>Each generator, in addition to target types that it can produce, have
    attribute that affects its applicability in particular sitiation. Those
    attributes are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Required properties, which are properties absolutely necessary for
      the generator to work. For example, generator encapsulating the gcc
      compiler would have &lt;toolset&gt;gcc as required property.</li>

      <li>Optional properties, which increase the generators suitability for
      a particual build.</li>
    </ol>
    Generator's required and optional properties may not include either free
    or incidental properties. (Allowing this would greatly complicate caching
    targets). 

    <p>When trying to construct a target, the first step is to select all
    possible generators for the requested target type, which required
    properties are a subset of requested properties. Generators which were
    already selected up the call stack are excluded. In addition, if any
    composing generators were selected up the call stack, all other composing
    generators are ignored (TODO: define composing generators). The found
    generators assigned a rank, which is the number of optional properties
    present in requested properties. Finally, generators with highest rank
    are selected for futher processing.</p>

    <h4>Running generators</h4>

    <p>When generators are selected, each is run to produce a list of created
    targets. This list might include targets which are not of requested
    types, because generators create the same targets as some tool, and
    tool's behaviour is fixed. (Note: should specify that in some cases we
    actually want extra targets). If generator fails, it returns an empty
    list. Generator is free to call 'construct' again, to convert sources to
    the types it can handle. It also can pass modified properties to
    'constuct'. However, a generator is not allowed to modify any propagated
    properties, otherwise when actually consuming properties we might
    discover that the set of propagated properties is different from what was
    used for building sources.</p>

    <p>For all targets which are not of requested types, we try to convert
    them to requested type, using a second call to <tt>construct</tt>. This
    is done in order to support transformation sequences where single source
    file expands to several later. See <a href=
    "http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jamboost/message/1667">this message</a>
    for details.</p>

    <h4>Selecting dependency graph</h4>
    After all generators are run, it is necessary to decide which of
    successfull invocation will be taken as final result. At the moment, this
    is not done. Instead, it is checked whether all successfull generator
    invocation returned the same target list. Error is issued otherwise. 

    <h4>Property adjustment</h4>

    <p>Because target location is determined by the build system, it is
    sometimes necessary to adjust properties, in order to not break actions.
    For example, if there's an action which generates a header, say
    "a_parser.h", and a source file "a.cpp" which includes that file, we must
    make everything work as if a_parser.h is generated in the same directory
    where it would be generated without any subvariants.</p>

    <p>Correct property adjustment can be done only after all targets are
    created, so the approach taken is:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>When dependency graph is constructed, each action can be assigned a
      rule for property adjustment.</li>

      <li>When virtual target is actualized, that rule is run and return the
      final set of properties. At this stage it can use information of all
      created virtual targets.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In case of quoted includes, no adjustment can give 100% correct
    results. If target dirs are not changed by build system, quoted includes
    are searched in "." and then in include path, while angle includes are
    searched only in include path. When target dirs are changed, we'd want to
    make quoted includes to be search in "." then in additional dirs and then
    in the include path and make angle includes be searched in include path,
    probably with additional paths added at some position. Unless, include
    path already has "." as the first element, this is not possible. So,
    either generated headers should not be included with quotes, or first
    element of include path should be ".", which essentially erases the
    difference between quoted and angle includes. <b>Note:</b> there only way
    to get "." as include path into compiler command line is via verbatim
    compiler option. In all other case, Boost.Build will convert "." into
    directory where it occurs.</p>

    <h4>Transformations cache</h4>
    Under certain conditions, an attempt is made to cache results of
    transformation search. First, the sources are replaced with targets with
    special name and the found target list is stored. Later, when properties,
    requested type, and source type are the same, the store target list is
    retrieved and cloned, with appropriate change in names.
