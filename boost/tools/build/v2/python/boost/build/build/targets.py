#  warranty, and with no claim as to its suitability for any purpose.

#   Supports 'abstract' targets, which are targets explicitly defined in Jamfile.
#
#   Abstract targets are represented by classes derived from 'AbstractTarget' class. 
#   The first abstract target is 'project_target', which is created for each
#   Jamfile, and can be obtained by the 'target' rule in the Jamfile's module.
#   (see project.jam). 
#
#   Project targets keep a list of 'MainTarget' instances.
#   A main target is what the user explicitly defines in a Jamfile. It is
#   possible to have several definitions for a main target, for example to have
#   different lists of sources for different platforms. So, main targets
#   keep a list of alternatives.
#
#   Each alternative is an instance of 'AbstractTarget'. When a main target
#   subvariant is defined by some rule, that rule will decide what class to
#   use, create an instance of that class and add it to the list of alternatives
#   for the main target.
#
#   Rules supplied by the build system will use only targets derived
#   from 'BasicTarget' class, which will provide some default behaviour.
#   There will be two classes derived from it, 'make-target', created by the
#   'make' rule, and 'TypedTarget', created by rules such as 'exe' and 'dll'.
