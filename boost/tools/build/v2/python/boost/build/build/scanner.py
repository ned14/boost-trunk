# Still to port.
# Original lines are prefixed with "#   "
#
#   #  Implements scanners: objects that compute implicit dependencies for
#   #  files, such as includes in C++.
#   #
#   #  Scanner has a regular expression used to find dependencies, some
#   #  data needed to interpret those dependencies (for example, include
#   #  paths), and a code which actually established needed relationship
#   #  between actual jam targets.
#   #
#   #  Scanner objects are created by actions, when they try to actualize
#   #  virtual targets, passed to 'virtual-target.actualize' method and are
#   #  then associated with actual targets. It is possible to use
#   #  several scanners for a virtual-target. For example, a single source
#   #  might be used by to compile actions, with different include paths.
#   #  In this case, two different actual targets will be created, each 
#   #  having scanner of its own.
#   #
#   #  Typically, scanners are created from target type and action's 
#   #  properties, using the rule 'get' in this module. Directly creating
#   #  scanners is not recommended, because it might create many equvivalent
#   #  but different instances, and lead in unneeded duplication of
#   #  actual targets. However, actions can also create scanners in a special
#   #  way, instead of relying on just target type.
