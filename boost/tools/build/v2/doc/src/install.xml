    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>
      Assuming you're installing Boost.Build from released source
      distribution, the following steps are needed. All paths are
      given relatively to Boost.Build root directory, which is the
      directory with the document you are reading.
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>
          Go to "jam_src" directory and build Boost.Jam. Two convenient
          scripts are provided, "build.sh" (for Unix systems) and
          "build.bat" (for Windows). Run the appropriate one and
          Boost.Jam will be built to directory
          <filename>bin.{platform_name}.</filename>. The <ulink url=
          "../jam_src/index.html">Boost.Jam documentation</ulink> has
          more details in case you need them.
        </simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Place the Boost.Jam binary, called "bjam" or "bjam.exe",
          somewhere in your <envar>PATH</envar>. Go to the root
          directory of Boost.Build and run "bjam --version". You should
          get 

          <screen>Boost.Build V2 (Milestone N)</screen>

          (where N is the version you've downloaded).
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>
          Configure toolsets to use. Open the
          <filename>user-config.jam</filename> file and follow
          instructions there to specify what compiles/libraries you
          have and where they are located.
        </simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <simpara>
          You should now be able to go to
          <filename>example/hello</filename>, and run
          <command>bjam</command> there. A simple application will be
          built. You can also play with other projects in
          <filename>example</filename>. 
    <!-- This part should not go into intoduction docs, but we need to
         place it somewhere. 

    <para>It is slighly better way is to copy
    <filename>new/user-config.jam</filename> into one of the locations
    where it can be found (given in <link linkend=
    "bbv2.reference.init.config">this table</link>). This prevent you
    from accidentally overwriting your config when updating.</para>

    <para>
      If you use Boost distribution, or Boost CVS, the Boost.Build
      root is located at <filename>$boost_root/tools/build/v2</filename>
      and the installation steps are the same. However, don't skip
      the bjam rebuilding step, even if you have a previous version.
      CVS version of Boost.Build requires CVS version of Boost.Jam.
    </para>

    <para>
      When starting a new project which uses Boost.Build, you need
      to make sure that build system can be found. There are two
      ways.
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>
          Set enviromnetal variable <envar>BOOST_BUILD_PATH</envar>
          to the absolute path to Boost.Build installation directory.
        </simpara>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Create, at the top of your project, a file called
          <filename>boost-build.jam</filename>, with a single line:

<programlisting>
boost-build /path/to/boost.build ;
</programlisting>

        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <para>If you're trying to use Boost.Build V2 on Boost itself, please
  note that when building Boost, V1 is used by default. You'd have
  to add <option>--v2</option> command line option to all "bjam"
  invocations.</para>
