    <para>
      This section describes how to install Boost.Build from a
      released <ulink
      url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&amp;package_id=8041">Boost
      source distribution</ulink>
      or <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=7586">CVS
      image</ulink>.
      <footnote>
        <para>Note that packages prepared for
      Unix/Linux systems usually make their own choices about where to
      put things and even which parts of Boost to include.  When we
      say &#x201C;released source distribution&#x201D; we mean a
      distribution of Boost as released on its SourceForge
      <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&amp;package_id=8041">project
      page</ulink>.

All paths are given relative to
      the <firstterm>Boost.Build v2 root directory</firstterm>, which is 

      <!-- the normal location of the document you are reading.
      Boost.Build is -->

      <!-- That is a lie AFAICT, at least in a Boost distro.  You need
      to say something that will be true if you want to cover BBv2 as
      distributed separately -->

      located in the <filename>tools/build/v2</filename> subdirectory
      of a full Boost <ulink url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&amp;package_id=8041">distribution</ulink>.
      <footnote>
        <para>The Boost.Build subset of boost is also distributed
        separately, for those who are only interested in getting a
        build tool. The top-level directory of a <ulink
        url="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&amp;package_id=80982">Boost.Build
        distribution</ulink> contains all the subdirectories of the
        <filename>tools/build/v2</filename> subdirectory from a full
        Boost distribution, so it is itself a valid Boost.Build root
        directory.  It also contains the
        <filename>tools/build/jam_src</filename> subdirectory of a
        full Boost distribution, so you can rebuild Boost.Jam from
        source.

          Boost.Build uses <ulink
          url= "../../tools/build/jam_src/index.html">Boost.Jam</ulink>, an
          extension of the <ulink
          url="http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html">Perforce
          Jam</ulink> portable <command>make</command> replacement. The
          recommended way to get Boost.Jam is to <emphasis

          a prebuilt executable</ulink></emphasis> from SourceForge.
          If a prebuilt executable is not provided for your platform
          or you are using Boost's sources in an unreleased state, it
          may be necessary to <ulink
          url= "../../tools/build/jam_src/index.html#building_bjam">build <command>bjam</command>

        <para>

          To install Boost.Jam, copy the executable,
          called <command>bjam</command>
          or <command>bjam.exe</command> to a location accessible in
          your <envar>PATH</envar>.  Go to the Boost.Build root
          directory and
          run <command>bjam <option>--version</option></command>. You
          should see:

          <screen>
            Boost.Build V2 (Milestone N)
            Boost.Jam xx.xx.xx 
          </screen>

        <simpara>
          Configure Boost.Build to recognize the build resources (such
          as compilers and libraries) you have installed on your
          system.  Open the
          <filename>user-config.jam</filename> file in the Boost.Build
          root directory and follow the instructions there to describe
          your toolsets and libraries, and, if necessary, where they
          are located.

          You should now be able to go to the
          <filename>example/hello/</filename> directory and run
          <command>bjam</command> there. A simple application will be
          built. You can also play with other projects in the
          <filename>example/</filename> directory. 
    <!-- This part should not go into intoduction docs, but we need to
         place it somewhere. 

    <para>It is slighly better way is to copy
    <filename>new/user-config.jam</filename> into one of the locations
    where it can be found (given in <link linkend=
    "bbv2.reference.init.config">this table</link>). This prevent you
    from accidentally overwriting your config when updating.</para>

      If you are using Boost's CVS state, be sure to
      rebuild <command>bjam</command> even if you have a previous
      version.  The CVS version of Boost.Build requires the CVS
      version of Boost.Jam.

    <para>
      When <command>bjam</command> is invoked, it always needs to be
      able to find the Boost.Build root directory, where the
      interpreted source code of Boost.Build is located.  There are
      two ways to tell <command>bjam</command> about the root directory:

          At the root directory of your project or in any of its

  When <command>bjam</command> is invoked from anywhere in the Boost
  directory tree <emphasis>other than</emphasis> the Boost.Build root
  and its subdirectories, <ulink url="../../tools/build">Boost.Build
  v1</ulink> is used by default. To override the default and use
  Boost.Build v2, you have to add the <option>--v2</option> command
