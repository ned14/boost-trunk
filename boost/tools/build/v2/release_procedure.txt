   Boost.Build V2 release procedure.

[ Must be done from a Unix shell ]

0. Make sure that "bjam --version" output is correct. Check the download
   locations in "index_v2.html".
  
1. Run

   cvs -d :ext:<your_user_name>@cvs.boost.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/boost co -P -d  boost-build boost/tools/build

   Note: it turns out that anonymous CVS access uses some backup server, which
   is not up-to-date.

2. Go to "boost-build" directory.

3. Run "./roll.sh". This will create "boost-build.zip" and
   "boost-build.tar.bz2" in parent directory, and also upload
   new docs to sourceforge.

4. Unpack "boost-build.tar.bz2", and build jam.

5. Go to "test" and copy "test-config.jam.in" to "test-config.jam". Run gcc
   tests:
      python test_all.py gcc

6. Build all projects in examples-v2, using the bjam binary created at step 4.
   Note: "threading=multi" might be needed to build QT examples.

7. Announce the release, etc.
