   Boost.Build V2 release procedure.

[ Must be done from a Unix shell ]



0. Look for all issues for current milestone in the tracker. Close the fixed one,
   if not already closed. Move to a later milestone, or fix all the unfixed
   ones.

   Make sure that "bjam --version" output is correct. Update version string if
   needed. Update bjam version and the version check is necessary.  
   Check the download locations in "index_v2.html". Check that "last modified"
   strings in docs are correct.

1. Make sure you don't have any local modification, and tag the CVS tree with 
   Milestone_X tag.
  
2. Run

   cvs -d :ext:<your_user_name>@cvs.boost.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/boost co -r
   Milestone_X -P -d  boost-build boost/tools/build

   Note: it turns out that anonymous CVS access uses some backup server, which
   is not up-to-date.

3. Go to "boost-build/v2" directory.

4. Run "./roll.sh". This will create "boost-build.zip" and
   "boost-build.tar.bz2" in parent directory, and also upload
   new docs to sourceforge.

5. Unpack "boost-build.tar.bz2", and build jam.

6. Go to "test" and copy "test-config.jam.in" to "test-config.jam". Run gcc
   tests:
      python test_all.py gcc

7. Build all projects in examples-v2, using the bjam binary created at step 4.
   Note: "threading=multi" might be needed to build QT examples.

8. Announce the release, etc.

9. Update the "next milestone query" in the tracker.
