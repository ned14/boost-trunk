    <h3><a name="features_properties">Features and properties</a></h3>

    <h4>Definition</h4>

    <p>A <em>feature</em> is a normalized (toolset-independent) aspect of a
    build configuration, such as whether inlining is enabled.</p>

    <p>A <em>feature value</em> is a specific available setting for a
    feature.</p>

    <p>A <em>property</em> is a (feature,value) pair, expressed as
    &lt;feature&gt;value.</p>

    <p>A <em>subfeature</em> is a feature which only exists in the presence
    of its parent, and whose identity can be derived (in the context of its
    parent) from the name of its value.</p>

    <p>A <em>value-string</em> is a string of the form
    <tt>value-subvalue1-subvalue2...-subvalueN</tt>, where <tt>value</tt> is
    a feature value and <tt>subvalue1...subvalueN</tt> are values of related
    subfeatures. For example, by using value-string properties
    &lt;toolset&gt;gcc &lt;toolset-version&gt;3.0.1, can be expressed more
    conscicely, as &lt;toolset&gt;gcc-3.0.1.</p>

    <p>A set of properties is called, naturally, <em>property set</em>. For
    example, <tt>&lt;toolset&gt;gcc &lt;runtime-link&gt;static</tt>.
    Sometimes it's better to represent a property set without spaces. In that
    case <em>property path</em> is used, which consists of all properties,
    joined with slashes. To continue with example, property path
    representation would be
    <tt>&lt;toolset&gt;gcc/&lt;runtime-link&gt;static</tt> .</p>

    <p>Each feature can have any of the following attributes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>incidental</em> 

        <p>Incidental features are assumed not affect build products at all.
        Warning level is one example. As a consequence, the build system
        doesn't try to avoid confusing targets with different values of
        incidental properties.</p>

        <p>Features which are not incidental are assumed to affect build
        products, therefore they are put in different directories as
        described in <a href="#target_paths">target paths</a> below.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>propagated</em> 

        <p>Features of this kind are propagated to dependencies. That is, if
        a <a href="#main_target">main target</a> is build with a particular
        value of a propagated feature, and depends on some other main
        targets, the build systems attempts to use subvariants of those main
        targets with the same value of the feature. For instance, binary
        compiled with optimization would use optimized libraries.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>free</em> 

        <p>Usually, each feature takes a single value from a fixed set. In
        particular, this means that only one value can be used when building
        a single target. When a feature is free, it can have several values
        at a time and each value can be an arbitrary string. For example, it
        is possible to have several preprocessor symbols defined
        simultaneously:</p>
<pre>
        &lt;define&gt;NDEBUG=1 &lt;define&gt;HAS_CONFIG_H=1
</pre>
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>optional</em> 

        <p>An optional feature is not required to have a value during build.
        When a value of non-optional non-free feature is not specified, it is
        always given the default value &mdash; which is the first value
        listed in the feature's declaration.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>symmetric</em> 

        <p>A symmetric feature's default value is not automatically included
        in <a href="#variants">build variants</a>. Normally a feature only
        generates a subvariant directory when its value differs from the
        value specified by the build variant, leading to an assymmetric
        subvariant directory structure for certain values of the feature. A
        symmetric feature, when relevant to the toolset, always generates a
        corresponding subvariant directory.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>path</em> 

        <p>The value of a path feature specifies a path. The path is treated
        as relative to the directory of Jamfile where path feature is used
        and is translated appropriately by the build system when the build is
        invoked from a different directory</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>implicit</em> 

        <p>Values of implicit features alone identify the feature. For
        example, a user is not required to write "&lt;toolset&gt;", but can
        simply write "gcc". Implicit feature names also don't appear in
        variant paths, although the values do. Thus: bin/gcc/... as opposed
        to bin/toolset-gcc/.... There should typically be only a few such
        features, to avoid possible name clashes.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>composite</em> 

        <p>Composite features actually correspond to groups of properties.
        For example, a build variant is a composite feature. When generating
        targets from a set of build properties, composite features are
        recursively expanded and <em>added</em> to the build property set, so
        rules can find them if neccessary. Non-composite non-free features
        override components of composite features in a build property
        set.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>link-incompatible</em> 

        <p>See <a href="#link_compatibility">below</a>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>dependency</em> 

        <div class="alert">
          Do we need it?
        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>TODO: document active features..</p>

    <h4 id="link_compatibility">Link compatible and incompatible
    properties</h4>

    <p>When the build system tries to generate a target (such as library
    dependency) matching a given build request, it may find that an exact
    match isn't possible &mdash; for example, the target may impose additonal
    build requirements. We need to determine whether a buildable version of
    that target can actually be used.</p>

    <p>In general, there are many possible situations: a libary which is
    dependency of a main target and should be linked into it, target which is
    directly requested on the command line, or build executable which is used
    in the build process itself. At this moment we use a simple approach.</p>

    <p>Two property sets are called <em>link-compatible</em> when targets
    with those property sets can be used interchangably. In turn, two
    property sets are link compatible when there's no link-incompatible
    feature which has different values in those property sets. Whenever
    requested and actual properties are link-compatible, it's OK. Otherwise,
    it's an error.</p>

    <h4>Definition of property refinement</h4>

    <p>When a target with certain properties is requested, and that target
    requires some set of properties, it is needed to find the set of
    properties to use for building. This process is called <em>property
    refinement</em> and is performed by these rules</p>

    <ol>
      <li>If original properties and required properties are not
      link-compatible, refinement fails.</li>

      <li>Each property in the required set is added to the original property
      set</li>

      <li>If the original property set includes property with a different
      value of non free feature, that property is removed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a name="initialization">Initialization</a></h3>

    <p>Immediately upon startup, the <tt>bjam</tt> executable attempts to
    find the location of build system files. It does so by looking for a file
    called <tt>boost-build.jam</tt>. That file is first looked in the
    invocation directory and its parents up to the filesystem root, and then
    in the directories from variable BOOST_BUILD_PATH. When found, the file
    is loaded and should specify the build system location by calling the
    <tt>boost-build</tt> rule:</p>
<pre>
    rule boost-build ( location ? )
   
</pre>
    The directory specified by location and directories in
    <tt>BOOST_BUILD_PATH</tt> are searched for a file called
    <tt>bootstrap.jam</tt> which is loaded and completes startup. 

    <p>This arrangement allows to make build system work without any
    environmental variables. For example, build system files can be placed in
    a directory <tt>boost-build</tt> at your project root, and a file
    <tt>boost-build.jam</tt> at the project root can contain:</p>
<pre>
    boost-build boost-build ;
   
</pre>
    In this case, running <tt>bjam</tt> in the project root will
    automatically find the build system. 

    <h3><a name="command_line">Command line</a></h3>

    <p>The comamnd line may contain:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Jam options,</li>

      <li>Boost.Build <a href="#command_line_options">options</a>,</li>

      <li>Command line arguments</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="command_line_arguments">Command line arguments</h4>
    Command line arguments specify targets and build request using the
    following rules. 

    <ul>
      <li>An argument which does not contain slashes or the "=" symbol is
      either a value of an implicit feature, or target to be built. It is
      taken to be value of a feature if appropriate feature exists.
      Otherwise, it is considered target name.</li>

      <li>
        An argument with either slashes or the "=" symbol specifies build
        properties. It is converted into a set of build properties as
        follows: 

        <ul>
          <li>The argument is split at each slash.</li>

          <li>
            Each component is converted into a set of properties as follows.
            If component is a value of implicit feature, the property set
            fill only include corresponding property, e.g. <tt>gcc</tt> will
            become <tt>&lt;toolset&gt;gcc</tt>. Otherwise, it should have the
            form 
<pre>
    &lt;feature-name&gt;=&lt;feature-value1&gt;[","&lt;feature-valueN&gt;]*
   
</pre>
            and the property set will be 
<pre>
&lt;feature-name&gt;feature-value1 ... &lt;feature-name&gt;feature-valueN
</pre>
          </li>

          <li>Property sets for each of the component are set-theoretically
          multiplicated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    For example, the command line 
<pre>
    target1 debug gcc/runtime-link=dynamic,static
   
</pre>
    would cause target called <tt>target1</tt> to be rebuild in debug mode,
    except that for gcc, both dynamically and statically linked binaries
    would be created. 

    <h4 id="command_line_options">Command line options</h4>

    <p>All of the Boost.Build options start with the "--" prefix. They are
    described in the following table.</p>

    <table align="center">
      <caption>
        Command line options
      </caption>

      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Option</th>

          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><tt>--debug</tt></td>

          <td>Enables internal checks.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><tt>--dump-projects</tt></td>

          <td>Cause the project structure to be output.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><tt>--help</tt></td>

          <td>Access to the online help system. This prints general
          information on how to use the help system with additional --help*
          options.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3><a name="projects">Projects</a></h3>

    <p>Boost.Build considers every software it build as organized into
    projects, each of which corresponds to a single Jamfile. Projects are
    organized in a hierarchical structure, so each project may have a single
    parent project and a number of subprojects. (TODO: project root).</p>

    <h4>Project attributes</h4>

    <p>For each project, there are several attributes.</p>

    <p><em>Project id</em> is a short way to denote a project, as opposed to
    the Jamfile's pathname. It is a hierarchical path, unrelated to
    filesystem, such as "boost/thread". There are two ways to refer to a
    project using project-id:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use absolute proejct-id, which starts with "/", for example
      <tt>/boost/thread</tt>.</li>

      <li>Use relative project-id, which is appended to the project-id of the
      project where it is used.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Source location</em> specifies the directory where sources for the
    project are located.</p>

    <p><em>Project requirements</em> are requirements that apply to all the
    targets in the projects as well as all subprojects.</p>

    <p><em>Default build</em> is the build request that should be used when
    no build request is specified explicitly.</p>

    <p>The default values for those attributes are given in the table below.
    In order to affect them, Jamfile may call the <tt>project</tt> rule. The
    rule has this syntax:</p>
<pre>
    project id : &lt;attributes&gt; ;
   
</pre>
    Here, attributes is a sequence of (attribute-name, attribute-value)
    pairs. The list of attribute names along with its handling is shown in
    the table below. For example, it it possible to write: 
<pre>
    project tennis 
        : requirements &lt;threading&gt;multi 
        : default-build release
        ;
   
</pre>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Attribute</th>

        <th>Name for the 'project' rule</th>

        <th>Default value</th>

        <th>Handling by the 'project' rule</th>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Project id</td>

        <td>none</td>

        <td>none</td>

        <td>Assigned from the first parameter of the 'project' rule. It is
        assumed to denote absolute project id.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Source location</td>

        <td><tt>source-location</tt></td>

        <td>The location of jamfile for the project</td>

        <td>Sets to the passed value</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Requirements</td>

        <td><tt>requirements</tt></td>

        <td>The parent's requirements</td>

        <td>The parent's requirements are refined with the passed requirement
        and the result is used as the project requirements.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Default build</td>

        <td><tt>default-build</tt></td>

        <td>TODO</td>

        <td>Sets to the passed value</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>Project relationship</h4>

    <p>There are three kinds of project relationships.</p>

    <p>First is parent-child. This relationship is established implicitly:
    parent directories of a project are searched, and the first found Jamfile
    is assumed to define the parent project. The parent-child relationship
    affects only attribute values for the child project.</p>

    <p>Second is build relationship. Some project may request to recursively
    build other projects. Those project need not be child projects. The
    <tt>build-project</tt> rule is used for that:</p>
<pre>
    build-project src ;   
</pre>

    <p>The third kind is the 'use' relationship. In means that one project
    uses targets from another. It is possible to just refer to target in
    other projects using target id. However, if target id uses project id, it
    is required that the project id is known. The <tt>use-project</tt> rule
    is employed to guarantee that.</p>
<pre>
    use-project ( id : location )
   
</pre>
    It loads the project at the specified location, which makes its project
    id available in the project which invokes the rule. It is required that
    the <tt>id</tt> parameter passed to the <tt>use-project</tt> rule be
    equal to the id that the loaded project declared. At this moment, the
    <tt>id</tt> paremeter should be absolute project id. 

    <h3><a name="targets">Targets</a></h3>

    <h4>Main targets and main target alternatives</h4>

    <p id="main_target"><em>Main target</em> is a named entity which can be
    build, for example a named executable file. To declare a main target,
    user invokes some of the <a href="#main_target_rules">main target
    rules</a>, passing it things like list of source and requirement.</p>

    <p>It is possible to have different list of sources for different
    toolsets, therefore it is possible to invoke main target rules several
    times for a single main target. For example:</p>
<pre>
    exe a : a_gcc.cpp : &lt;toolset&gt; ;
    exe a : a.cpp ;
</pre>
    Each call to the 'exe' rule defines a new <em>main target
    alternative</em> for the main target <tt>a.exe</tt>. In this case, the
    first alternative will be used for the <tt>gcc</tt> toolset, while the
    second alternative will be used in other cases. TODO: document the exact
    selection method under "Build process" below. 

    <h4>Target identifiers and references</h4>

    <p><em>Target identifier</em> is used to denote a target. It is described
    by the following grammar:</p>
<pre>
    target-id -&gt; project-reference local-target-name
    project-reference -&gt; [jamfile-location] [ "@" [project-id] ]
    jamfile-location -&gt; pathname 
    project-id -&gt; pathname
    local-target-name -&gt; identifier
</pre>
    For example, valid target ids might be: 
<pre>
    a
    lib/b
    @/boost/thread
    /home/ghost/build/lr_library@parser/lalr1
</pre>
    To map the target id into target, the project where that target is
    contained is first found: 

    <ol>
      <li>If <tt>project-reference</tt> is empty, then the current project is
      used &mdash; i.e. the project there the target id occurs.</li>

      <li>If the project id is absolute, the project with that id is
      used.</li>

      <li>If the project id is relative, it is treated relatively to
      project-id of the project at <tt>jamfile-location</tt>. If that project
      does not declare project id, it is an error.</li>
    </ol>
    After that, the target given by <tt>local-target-name</tt> in the found
    project is used. 

    <p><em>Target reference</em> is used to specify a source target, and may
    additionally specify desired properties for that target. It has this
    syntax:</p>
<pre>
    target-reference -&gt; target-id [ "/" requested-properties ]
    requested-properties -&gt; property-path
</pre>
    For example, 
<pre>
    exe compiler : compiler.cpp libs/cmdline/&lt;optimization&gt;space ;
</pre>
    would cause the version of <tt>cmdline</tt> library, optimized for space,
    to be linked in even if the <tt>compile</tt> executable is build with
    optimization for speed. 

    <h5>Ambiguity resolution</h5>

    <p>Target reference may have the same form as a pathname, for example
    <tt>lib/a</tt>. In order to determine if this is target reference or
    pathname, it is checked if there's a jamfile in the specified path. If
    there is one, it is loaded and if the specified target is declared by
    that project it is used. Otherwise, we just treat the target reference as
    a file name.</p>

    <h4>Target paths</h4>

    <p>To distinguish targets build with different properties, they are put
    in different directories. Rules for determining target paths are given
    below:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>All targets are placed under directory corresponding to the project
      where they are defined.</li>

      <li>Each non free, non incidental property cause an additional element
      to be added to the target path. That element has the form
      <tt>&lt;feature-name&gt;-&lt;feature-value&gt;</tt> for ordinary
      features and <tt>&lt;feature-value&gt;</tt> for implicit ones. [Note
      about composite features].</li>

      <li>If the set of free, non incidental properties is different from the
      set of free, non incidental properties for the project in which the
      main target that uses the target is defined, a part of the form
      <tt>main_target-&lt;name&gt;</tt> is added to the target path.
      <b>Note:</b>It would be nice to completely track free features also,
      but this appears to be complex and not extremely needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For example, we might have these paths:</p>
<pre>
    debug/optimization-off
    debug/main-target-a
   
</pre>

    <h3><a name="build_process">Build process</a></h3>

    <p>The build works in this way. On startup, the project in the current
    directory is read. In turn, it may request building of other projects,
    which will be loaded recursively. Parent projects are also loaded to
    inherit some of their properties. As the result, a tree of projects is
    constructed. After that, the build request is constructed from the
    command line. Then, the steps are:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>All of the projects to be build are passed the build request. If
      the build request does not satisfy the project's requirements, a
      warning is issued and the build of the project is skipped. Projects
      mentioned in <tt>build-project</tt> rule will still be build.</li>

      <li>
        An attempts to make all the main targets in the project is performed.
        For each main target: 

        <ol>
          <li>All main target alternatives which requirements are satisfied
          by the build request are enumerated.</li>

          <li>If there are several such alternatives, the one which longer
          requirements list is selected.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        For each selected alternative 

        <ol>
          <li>Each target reference in the source list are recursively
          constructed.</li>

          <li>The dependency graph for the target is constructed by running
          so called matching process, using generated source targets and
          ordinary sources.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The dependency graph constructed for each target is build of so called
    "virtual targets", which do not yet correspond to jam's targets. It is
    therefore converted to jam's dependency graph which is then build.</p>
