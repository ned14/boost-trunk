CODING CONVENTIONS.

    1. All names of rules and variables are lowercase with "-" to separate
    words.

        rule call-me-ishmael ( ) ...

    2. Names with dots in them are "intended globals". Ordinary globals use
    a dot prefix:

        .foobar
        $(.foobar)

    3. Pseudofunctions or associations are <parameter>.<property>:

        $(argument).name = hello ;
        $($(argument).name)

    4. Class attribute names are prefixed with "self.":

        self.x
        $(self.x)

    5. Builtin rules are called via their ALL_UPPERCASE_NAMES:

        DEPENDS $(target) : $(sources) ;

    6. Opening and closing braces go on separate lines:

        if $(a)
        {
            #
        }
        else
        {
            #
        }

HTML DOCUMENTATION.

    Please pass HTML files though HTML Tidy (http://tidy.sf.net) before
    comitting. This has to important purposes:
    - detecting bad HTML
    - converting files to uniform indentation style, which inverses effect
      of different editors and makes differences between revisions much
      smaller and easy for review.

    Alas, the way Tidy indents HTML differs between version. Please use
    the version awailable at

       http://tidy.sourceforge.net/src/old/tidy_src_020411.tgz

    and "-i -wrap 78" command line parameters.
