# Example of how to define and depend on a library target.
# This is for Boost.Build-V1

subproject sublib ;

# Declare the library target. Composed of a single source file.
# The real name of the target will vary according to the build
# build platform. For example in Unix it will generate a file
# named "libsimple.a".
#
# In this example the default build is given so that it builds
# two default versions of the library: debug with single-threading,
# and debug with multi-threading.

lib simple
