Boost Build system TODO
===== ===== ====== ====
Items preceded by ** are complete.

Implement linking with prebuilt libraries. Should be trivial, except for
    choosing different libraries for different variants. This might require
    allowing sources to be qualified with toolset/variant grist. Also argues for
    a different syntax for library dependencies: <lib> is too
    confusable. Perhaps <#> or some other symbolic name.

Implement <sysinclude> feature for separately searching #include <...> paths?
    I think this may be a bad idea, since it isn't a portable feature. Maybe it
    would be best to try to get all compilers to work with the same #include
    search algorithm.

Clean up documentation
    ** TOC hyperlinks
    describe gristing
    revise free/path feature definition
    
Add a hook function to allow output directory customization that some people
want (instead of subdirectories, string together short names with '-').

Platform support:
    Unix paths on Mac/VMS
    Integrate Win95/98/ME support

    Since the above require modification to Jam compiled source, getting the
    code into the Perforce public depot would be good at this point.

Compile allyourbase/boost-base.jam into Jam itself.
    It might be best to review differences between allyourbase.jam and Jambase,
    and arrange the new Jambase to be a superset of the perforce Jambase so that
    a boost-compiled Jam can be used on standard Jambase projects without
    modification. OTOH, people can always use -f with the standard Jambase.

Open problem:
    How do we get Metrowerks STDHDRS properly initialized? The corresponding
    shell variables don't end in PATH nor do they follow the correct syntax for
    the -I option (e.g. they have preceding '+' signs).

Testing
    Linux
    Other Unices
    MacOS

Better support for single-valued free features. GCC needs a default
    ftemplate-depth-NN setting which can be overridden.

** A way to factor toolset commonality, e.g. for STLPort versions of a toolset

=== for test system ===

Add platform library path to <runtime-link>dynamic executable targets' RUN_PATH,
    so they can be run even without the tools set up in the environment.

Add Jam rules for constructing build/test tools (built exes used for build/test). 
    Must only try to build one compiler/variant of these

Implement some test tools:
    success/failure inverter for expected failures (must prefix build actions to
    be able to use it)
    
    automatic PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH adjustment to account for DLL/runtime lib
    dependencies, so even exes with dynamically-linked library dependencies can
    be run through the test system. I think it is possible to do this entirely
    in Jam with some hackery.
    
    Facilities to update boost html compiler status page


=== FTJam core requests ===

In debugging output, indirect rule invocations should reflect the rule name
being invoked.

Fix modulus on nesting in debug output, so my emacs stepping tools don't get
confused.

Expand MAXLINE for NT, possibly as described by Chris Antos.

Implement a way to invert the result of a rule, so that failure becomes success.
