<h2>Regression Testing Notes</h2>
<h3>Note <a name="0">0</a></h3>
<p>This test fails only intermittently.</p>
<h3>Note <a name="1">1</a></h3>
<p>The failure is caused by a problem in Boost code. The Boost developer is 
aware of the problem and plans to fix it.</p>
<h3>Note <a name="2">2</a></h3>
<p>The failure is caused by a compiler bug.</p>
<h3>Note <a name="3">3</a></h3>
<p>The failure is caused by a compiler bug, which has been reported to the 
compiler supplier (or is already known to them).</p>
<h3>Note <a name="4">4</a></h3>
<p>The failure is caused by a standard library bug.</p>
<h3>Note <a name="5">5</a></h3>
<p>The failure is caused by a standard library bug, which has been reported to 
the standard library supplier (or is already known to them).</p>
<h3>Note <a name="6">6</a></h3>
<p>The failure is probably caused by the test code, harness, or configuration. 
Thus it may not affect users of the library.</p>
<h3>Note <a name="9">9</a></h3>
<p>The failure is serious and likely to prevent all use of this Boost library 
with this compiler.</p>
<h3>Note <a name="10">10</a></h3>
<p>The failure is serious and likely to prevent all use of this Boost library 
with this compiler. The failure is caused by a compiler bug, which has been reported to the 
compiler supplier (or is already known to them).</p>
<h3>Note <a name="14">14</a></h3>
<p>The failure is caused by a platform API bug.</p>
<h3>Note <a name="15">15</a></h3>
<p>The failure is caused by a platform API bug, which has been reported to 
the platform API supplier (or is already known to them).</p>
<h3>Note <a name="16">16</a></h3>
<p>The failure is not serious and will not affect most users. The library degrades gracefully.</p>
<h3>Note <a name="17">17</a></h3>
<p>This compiler's bugs are not supported by the library.</p>
