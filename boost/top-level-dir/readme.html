<h1 align="left">Spirit 1.6.4 with miniboost</h1>
<p align="left">This package comes bundled with a minimal subset of boost; just enough to use Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this release there is no separate <strong>miniboost</strong> directory, unlike the previous 1.6.x releases. This is an actual subset of the proper <strong>Boost</strong> distribution, containing all the headers and libraries required to use Spirit, run the regression tests and build the examples.</p>
<p>Historically, Spirit supported a lot of compilers, including (to some extent) poorly conforming compilers such as VC6. Spirit v1.6.x will be the last release that will support older poorly conforming compilers. Starting from Spirit v1.8.0, ill conforming compilers will not be supported. If you are still using one of these older compilers, you can still use Spirit v1.6.x.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The docs for Spirit are located in the <strong>libs/spirit/doc</strong> subdirectory.</li>
  <li>The library is under the <strong>boost</strong> subdirectory.</li>
  <li>The examples are in <strong>libs/spirit/example</strong></li>
  <li>The test suite is in <strong>libs/spirit/test</strong>.</li>
  <li>The Spirit homepage is <strong><a href="http://spirit.sourceforge.net/">http://spirit.sourceforge.net/</a></strong></li>
  <li>Questions, comments, complaints, bug-fixes? Please send them to the Spirit mailing list: <strong>spirit-general@lists.sourceforge.net</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Running the tests</h2>
<p>The testsuite can be executed by using the Boost.Build v.2 system as described on the Boost pages: <strong><a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a></strong>. </p>
<p>For example, using MSVC 8.0:</p>
<ol><li>Download a prebuilt executable of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941">bjam.exe</a>. Put it somewhere in your path.</li>
  <li>With the latest Boost Build, you don't have to configure the tool if you installed VC8.0 in the default location. Note , however, that MSVC 8.0 Express requires the Platform SDK from Microsoft. See the boost documentation.</li>
  <li>Change (<span class="style1">CD</span>)  the directory to <strong>libs/spirit/test</strong>.</li>
  <li>Call bjam:<br>
    <br>
    <span class="style1">bjam toolset=msvc-8.0 test</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some compilers may not be able to compile all of the tests and examples.</p>
<h2>Using the library</h2>
<p>There are no libraries to build, Spirit is a header-only library. Simply point your compiler's include path to the spirit directory. The library is under the <strong>boost</strong> subdirectory</p>
<h2>Building the examples</h2>
<p>The examples can be built by using the Boost.Build system as described on the Boost pages: <strong><a href="http://www.boost.org">http://www.boost.org</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For example, using MSVC 8.0, follow the instructions above (Running the tests) <strong>except 3</strong>. CD to <strong>libs/spirit/example</strong> instead. </p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you want to build spirit as thread safe, you have to define the BOOST_SPIRIT_THREADSAFE macro. If that's the case, Spirit uses the boost thread library. </li>
  <li>Some compilers may not be able to compile all of the tests and examples. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Phoenix</h2>
<p>Phoenix is a stand alone library that comes bundled in this distribution. If you wish to build the examples and run the testsuites for this library, the process is similar to what was outlined above. For example, using MSVC 8.0, follow the instructions above (Running the tests) <strong>except 3</strong>. CD to the appropriate test or example directory instead. </p>
