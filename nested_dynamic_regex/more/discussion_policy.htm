  <h1>Boost Discussion Policy</h1>

  <p>Email discussion is the tie that binds boost members together into a
  community. If the discussion is stimulating and effective, the community
  thrives. If the discussion degenerates into name calling and ill will, the
  community withers and dies.</p>

  <h2><a name="effective" id="effective"></a>Effective Posting</h2>

  <p>Most Boost mailing lists host a great deal of traffic, so your post is
  usually competing for attention with many other communications. This
  section describes how to make sure it has the desired impact.</p>

  <h3>Well-Crafted Posting is Worth the Effort</h3>

  <p>Don't forget, you're a single writer but there are many readers, and you
  want them to stay interested in what you're saying. Saving your readers a
  little time and effort is usually worth the extra time you spend when
  writing a message. Also, boost discussions are saved for posterity, as
  rationales and history of the work we do. A post's usefulness in the future
  is determined by its readability.</p>

  <h3>Put the Library Name in the Subject Line</h3>

  <p>When your post is related to a particular Boost library, it's helpful to
  put the library name in square brackets at the beginning of the subject
  line, e.g.</p>

  <blockquote>
    Subject: [Regex] Why doesn't this pattern match?
  </blockquote>The Boost developers' list is a high-volume mailing list, and
  most maintainers don't have time to read every message. A tag on the
  subject line will help ensure the right people see your post.

  <p><a name="tabs" id="tabs"></a></p>

  <h3>Don't Use Tabs</h3>If you use tabs to indent your source code, convert
  them to spaces before inserting the code in a posting. Something in the
  processing chain usually strips all the indentation and leaves a mess
  behind.

  <p><a name="longlines" id="longlines"></a></p>

  <h3>Limit Line Length</h3>If you put source code in your postings and your
  mailer wraps long lines automatically, either keep the code narrow or
  insert the code as an (inline, if possible) attachment. That will help
  ensure others can read what you've posted.

  <p><a name="quoting" id="quoting"></a></p>

  <h3>Don't Overquote</h3>Please <b>prune extraneous quoted text</b> from
  replies so that only the relevant parts are included. Some people have to
  pay for, or wait for, each byte that they download from the list. More
  importantly, it will save time and make your post more valuable when
  readers do not have to find out which exact part of a previous message you
  are responding to.

  <h3>Use a Readable Quotation Style</h3>

  <p>A common and very useful approach is to cite the small fractions of the
  message you are actually responding to and to put your response directly
  beneath each citation, with a blank line separating them for
  readability:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
<i>Person-you're-replying-to</i> wrote:

&gt; Some part of a paragraph that you wish to reply to goes 
&gt; here; there may be several lines.

Your response to that part of the message goes here.  There may,
of course, be several lines.

&gt; The second part of the  paragraph that is relevant to your 
&gt; reply goes here; agiain there may be several lines.

Your response to the second part of the message goes here.
...

</pre>
  </blockquote>For more information about effective use of quotation in
  posts, see <a href="http://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html">this
  helpful guide</a>.

  <h3>Keep the Formatting of Quotations Consistent</h3>

  <p>Some email and news clients use poor word wrapping algorithms that leave
  successive lines from the same quotation with differing numbers of leading
  "<tt>&gt;</tt>" characters. <b>Microsoft Outlook</b> and <b>Outlook
  Express</b>, and some web clients, are especially bad about this. If your
  client offends in this way, please take the effort to clean up the mess it
  makes in quoted text. Remember, even if you didn't write the original text,
  it's <i>your</i> posting; whether you get your point across depends on its
  readability.</p>

  <p>The Microsoft clients also create an unusually verbose header at the
  beginning of the original message text and leave the cursor at the
  beginning of the message, which encourages users to write their replies
  before all of the quoted text rather than putting the reply in context.
  Fortunately, Dominic Jain has written a utility that fixes all of these
  problems automatically: <a href=
  "http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/outlook-quotefix/">Outlook
  Quotefix</a> for Outlook Users and <a href=
  "http://home.in.tum.de/~jain/software/oe-quotefix/">OE QuoteFix</a> for
  users of Outlook Express.</p>

  <h3>Summarizing and Referring to Earlier Messages</h3>

  <p>A summary of the foregoing thread is only needed after a long
  discussion, especially when the topic is drifting or a result has been
  achieved in a discussion. The mail system will do the tracking that is
  needed to enable mail readers to display message threads (and every decent
  mail reader supports that).</p>

  <p>If you ever have to refer to single message earlier in a thread or in a
  different thread then you can use a URL to the <a href=
  "mailing_lists.htm#archive">message archives</a>. To help to keep those
  URLs short, you can use <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a>.
  Citing the relevant portion of a message you link to is often helpful (if
  the citation is small).</p>

  <h3>Maintain the Integrity of Discussion Threads</h3>

  <p><b>When starting a new topic, always send a fresh message</b>, rather
  than beginning a reply to some other message and replacing the subject and
  body. Many mailers are able to detect the thread you started with and will
  show the new message as part of the original thread, which probably isn't
  what you intended. Follow this guideline for your own sake as well as for
  others'. Often, people scanning for relevant messages will decide they're
  done with a topic and hide or kill the entire thread: your message will be
  missed, and you won't get the response you're looking for.</p>

  <p>By the same token, <b>When replying to an existing message, use your
  mailer's "Reply" function</b>, so that the reply shows up as part of the
  same discussion thread.</p>

  <p><b>Do not reply to digests</b> if you are a digest delivery subscriber.
  Your reply will not be properly threaded and will probably have the wrong
  subject line. Instead, you can reply through the <a href=
  "http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.boost.devel">GMane web
  interface</a>.</p>

  <h3>Keep The Size of Your Posting Manageable</h3>

  <p>The mailing list software automatically limits message and attachment
  size to a reasonable amount, typically 75K, which is adjusted from
  time-to-time by the moderators. This limit is a courtesy to those who rely
  on dial-up Internet access.</p>

  <h2><a name="behavior" id="behavior"></a>Prohibited Behavior</h2>

  <p>Prohibited behavior will not be tolerated. The moderators will ban
  postings by abusers.</p>

  <h3>Flame wars</h3>

  <p>Personal insults, argument for the sake of argument, and all the other
  behaviors which fall into the "flame war" category are prohibited.
  Discussions should focus on technical arguments, not the personality traits
  or motives of participants.</p>

  <h3>Third-party attacks</h3>

  <p>Attacks on third parties such as software vendors, hardware vendors, or
  any other organizations, are prohibited. Boost exists to unite and serve
  the entire C++ community, not to disparage the work of others.</p>

  <p>Does this mean that we ban the occasional complaint or wry remark about
  a troublesome compiler? No, but be wary of overdoing it.</p>

  <h3>Off-topic posts</h3>

  <p>Discussions which stray from the acceptable topics are strongly
  discouraged. While off-topic posts are often well meaning and not as
  individually corrosive as other abuses, cumulatively the distraction
  damages the effectiveness of discussion.</p>

  <h2><a name="culture" id="culture"></a>Culture</h2>

  <p>In addition to technical skills, Boost members value collaboration,
  acknowledgement of the help of others, and a certain level of politeness.
  Boost membership is very international, and ranges widely in age and other
  characteristics. Think of discussion as occurring among colleagues in a
  widely read forum, rather than among a few close friends.</p>

  <p>Always remember that the cumulative effort spent by people reading your
  contribution scales with the (already large) number of boost members. Thus,
  do invest time and effort to make your message as readable as possible.
  Adhere to English syntax and grammar rules such as proper capitalization.
  Avoid copious informalism, colloquial language, or abbreviations, they may
  not be understood by all readers. Re-read your message before submitting
  it.</p>

  <h2>Guidelines for Effective Discussions</h2>

  <p>Apply social engineering to prevent heated technical discussion from
  degenerating into a shouting match, and to actively encourage the
  cooperation upon which Boost depends.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Questions help. If someone suggests something that you don't think
    will work, then replying with a question like "will that compile?" or
    "won't that fail to compile, or am I missing something?" is a lot
    smoother than "That's really stupid - it won't compile."&nbsp; Saying
    "that fails to compile for me, and seems to violate section n.n.n of the
    standard" would be yet another way to be firm without being
    abrasive.</li>

    <li>If most of the discussion has been code-free generalities, posting a
    bit of sample code can focus people on the practical issues.</li>

    <li>If most of the discussion has been in terms of specific code, try to
    talk a bit about hidden assumptions and generalities that may be
    preventing discussion closure.</li>

    <li>Taking a time-out is often effective. Just say: "Let me think about
    that for a day or two. Let's take a time-out to digest the discussion so
    far."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Avoid <i><b>Parkinson's Bicycle Shed</b></i>. Parkinson described a
  committee formed to oversee design of an early nuclear power plant. There
  were three agenda items - when to have tea, where to put the bicycle shed,
  and how to ensure nuclear safety. Tea was disposed of quickly as
  trivial.&nbsp;Nuclear safety was discussed for only an hour - it was so
  complex, scary, and technical that even among experts few felt comfortable
  with the issues. Endless days were then spent discussing construction of
  the bicycle shed (the parking lot would be the modern equivalent) because
  everyone though they understood the issues and felt comfortable discussing
  them.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2><a name="lib_names" id="lib_names"></a>Library Names</h2>

  <p>In order to ensure a uniform presentation in books and articles, we have
  adopted a convention for referring to Boost libraries. Library names can
  either be written in a compact form with a dot, as "Boost.<i>Name</i>", or
  in a long form as "the Boost <i>Name</i> library." For example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b>Boost.Python</b> serves a very different purpose from <b>the Boost
    Graph library</b>.
  </blockquote>Note that the word "library" is not part of the name, and as
  such isn't capitalized.

  <p>Please take care to avoid confusion in discussions between libraries
  that have been accepted into Boost and those that have not. Acceptance as a
  Boost library indicates that the code and design have passed through our
  peer-review process; failing to make the distinction devalues the hard work
  of library authors who've gone through that process. Here are some
  suggested ways to describe potential Boost libraries:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the proposed Boost <i>Name</i> library</li>

    <li>the Boost.<i>Name</i> candidate</li>

    <li>the <i>Name</i> library (probably the best choice where
    applicable)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that this policy only applies to discussions, not to the
  documentation, directory structure, or even identifiers in the code of
  potential Boost libraries.</p>
