[section:intro]

Open source isn't just for nerds and researchers.  Real world programming challenges,
irrespective of whether they are open or closed source, can benefit enormously from
the thought and experience that has gone into the Boost software libraries.  Put simply,
for any given problem for which Boost provides a solution, Boost will strive to provide 
the best solution possible.  It's up to you to decide whether we've achieved that, but
as these pages will testify, many other developers have found our solutions to be the 
best for them.

['Disclaimer:] Boost's developers try to ensure that the 
information on these pages is correct, but from time to time inadvertent 
mistakes are bound to occur:

[section:shrink Shrink Wrapped Boost]

Boost has found it's way into many products that are available "off the shelf",
including consumer applications from Adobe, through to business
middleware from SAP.

[blurb [*Adobe Photoshop CS2]\n\n
[@http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/main.html Adobe Photoshop CS2] 
uses the 
[@http://opensource.adobe.com/ Adobe Software Libraries], which in
turn depend upon large parts of Boost.  The [@http://opensource.adobe.com/ 
Adobe Software Libraries] are being rolled
out across the Adobe product line to provide cross platform user interface logic.

[blurb [*Adobe Indesign]\n\n
[@http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html Adobe Indesign] offers
best of breed page design:

[blurb [*Real Networks, Rhapsody]\n\n
The [@http://www.real.com/ Rhapsody Music Service] allows its subscribers to legally
download/transfer/burn over a million songs. The Rhapsody client

['"[@../../libs/format/index.html Format]: Boost.Format is top notch. Using it is a bliss.\n
[@../../libs/functional/index.html Functional], 
[@../../libs/function/index.html Function], 
and [@../../libs/bind/index.html Bind]: These three libraries, 
along with smart pointer are the most used in our application. I could not imagine
not having them handy.\n
[@../../libs/smart_ptr/index.html Smart Pointer]: Hands down, the most useful, and used library of the lot!\n
[@../../libs/date_time/index.html Date Time]: Simple to use, effective, does the job. I love the
flexible input string parsing facilities, and the
human readable ISO output.\n
[@../../libs/iterator/index.html Iterators]: Wow. Moving legacy iterating interfaces, or
interfaces that should of been properly designed
as iterators to STL compliant iterators was easy
and painless. The gains in functionality to our
code made by this library are invaluable.\n
[@../../libs/regex/index.html Regex]: When you need it, it works magic.\n
[@../../libs/thread/index.html Thread]: Used to implement the monitor pattern in key areas.\n
[@../../libs/preprocessor/index.html Preprocessor]: Used to implement repetitive unit-test
code generation. The codebase benefited
greatly from the clarity boost.preprocessor
brought."]

Tokens are defined as POSIX regular expressions and rules are defined
in a similar syntax quasi as regular expressions of regular
expressions. The construction of parse trees and their traversal is
supported.\n\n

[section:open Open Source Boost]

Boost is used in a variety of Open Source Projects, both applications and libraries.
Indeed many Open Source libraries developed around Boost have in the past been judged
of high enough quality to be absorbed
into the main Boost source tree, a process that will no doubt continue into the future.  
Others are in highly specialized niche markets, ranging from probability theory to
astronomy, via mass spectroscopy: whatever your field of interest you'll find
something of value in Boost.

[@http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/ CodeSynthesis XML 
Schema to C++ Data Binding Compiler (XSD)] is an
open-source, cross-platform XML Data Binding implementation for C++.
Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema), it generates
C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and
serialization code. You can then access the data stored in XML using
types and functions that semantically correspond to your application
domain rather than dealing with elements, attributes, and text in a
direct representation of XML such as DOM or SAX.
\n\n
XSD uses the [@../../libs/regex/index.html Regex] and 
[@../../libs/filesystem/index.html Filesystem] libraries from Boost. 
[@../../libs/regex/index.html Regex] is used
to perform transformations on file, type and member names. 
[@../../libs/filesystem/index.html Filesystem] is used to

Hydranode runs on wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux,
BSD, Mac OS, Solaris etc.\n\n
['"Hydranode Engine and plugins rely heavily on the following Boost
libraries: Bind, Function, Lambda, MultiIndex, Signals, Threads,
Smart Pointer, Format, Lexical Cast. Other Boost libraries being used
include FileSystem, String Algorithm, Date Time, Program Options, Spirit,
Random, Tokenizer, Type Traits, Tribool, Tuple and Any. Once Boost 1.33
is released, I'm also looking forward to using the Boost Iostreams library
in Hydranode.\n\n
All complex data structures in Hydranode are implemented using
Multi Index containers, which significantly reduced development time
and kept code clean. Format is being used for all text formatting.
Having Threads and FileSystem libraries available made cross-platform
development lot easier in those areas."]
