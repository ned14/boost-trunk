[section:intro Introduction]

Open source isn't just for nerds and researchers.  Real world programming challenges,
irrespective of whether they are open or closed source, can benefit enormously from
the thought and experience that has gone into the Boost software libraries.  Put simply,
for any given problem for which Boost provides a solution, Boost will strive to provide 
the best solution possible.  It's up to you to decide whether we've achieved that, but
as these pages will testify, many other developers have found our solutions to be the 
best for them.

['Disclaimer:] Boost's developers try to ensure that the 
information on these pages is correct, but from time to time inadvertent 
mistakes are bound to occur:
if you would like an entry in these pages to be removed or corrected please contact
the [@mailto:boost-owner@lists.boost.org Boost Moderators].

[section:shrink Shrink Wrapped Boost]

Boost has found it's way into many products that are available "off the shelf",
including consumer applications from Adobe, through to business
middleware from SAP.

out across the Adobe product line to provide cross platform user interface logic.

[blurb [*Real Networks, Rhapsody]

The [@http://www.real.com/ Rhapsody Music Service] allows its subscribers to legally
download/transfer/burn over a million songs. The Rhapsody client
software was built with many Boost libraries:

__format: Boost.Format is top notch. Using it is a bliss.

__functional, 
__function, 
and __bind: These three libraries, 
along with __smart are the most used in our application. I could not imagine
not having them handy.

__smart: Hands down, the most useful, and used library of the lot!

__date_time: Simple to use, effective, does the job. I love the
flexible input string parsing facilities, and the
human readable ISO output.

__iterator: Wow. Moving legacy iterating interfaces, or
interfaces that should of been properly designed
as iterators to STL compliant iterators was easy
and painless. The gains in functionality to our
code made by this library are invaluable.

__regex: When you need it, it works magic.

__thread: Used to implement the monitor pattern in key areas.

__preprocessor: Used to implement repetitive unit-test
code generation. The codebase benefited
greatly from the clarity __preprocessor
brought.

[section:open Open Source Boost]

Boost is used in a variety of Open Source Projects, both applications and libraries.
Indeed many Open Source libraries developed around Boost have in the past been judged
of high enough quality to be absorbed
into the main Boost source tree, a process that will no doubt continue into the future.  
Others are in highly specialized niche markets, ranging from probability theory to
astronomy, via mass spectroscopy: whatever your field of interest you'll find
something of value in Boost.

[blurb [*CodeSynthesis XML Schema to C++ Data Binding Compiler (XSD) by Code Synthesis Tools CC]

[@http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/ CodeSynthesis XML 
Schema to C++ Data Binding Compiler (XSD)] is an
open-source, cross-platform XML Data Binding implementation for C++.
Provided with an XML instance specification (XML Schema), it generates
C++ classes that represent the given vocabulary as well as parsing and
serialization code. You can then access the data stored in XML using
types and functions that semantically correspond to your application
domain rather than dealing with elements, attributes, and text in a
direct representation of XML such as DOM or SAX.

XSD uses __regex and 
__file_system libraries from Boost. 
__regex is used
to perform transformations on file, type and member names. 
__file_system is used to 
capture and manipulate XML Schema include and import paths.
Additionally, we are planning to provide an optional mapping of XML
Schema date and time types to C++ types from the Boost 
__date_time library.

[blurb [*Hydranode Engine]

[@http://hydranode.com/ Hydranode Engine] 
is a plugin-driven P2P client engine that relies
heavily on Boost libraries. Hydranode codebase is licenced under GNU
GPL, and is developed mainly by Alo Sarv. Currently in Beta phase,
Hydranode runs on wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux,
BSD, Mac OS, Solaris etc.

['"Hydranode Engine and plugins rely heavily on the following Boost
libraries: __bind, __function, __lambda, __multi_index, __signals, Threads,
__smart, Format, __lexical_cast. Other Boost libraries being used
include __file_system, __string_algo, __date_time, __program_options, __spirit,
__random, __tokenizer, __type_traits, __tribool, __tuple and __any. Once Boost 1.33
is released, I'm also looking forward to using the Boost Iostreams library
in Hydranode.]

['"All complex data structures in Hydranode are implemented using
__multi_index containers, which significantly reduced development time
and kept code clean. Format is being used for all text formatting.
Having __thread and __file_system libraries available made cross-platform
development lot easier in those areas."]

['"Profdist is a tool for the construction of large phylogenetic trees based on
profile distances. The input alignment data gets extended by random
picking of rows, and a clustering technique is used to create profiles
of the most frequent subtrees. The iterative approach allows working on
large datasets. Currently the application is very limited by the quality of 
wxWidgets, and only available for Windows and Linux. ]

The Boost libraries enable us to get a higher degree of uniformity and 
quality in our code. During a redesign last year we found that lots of 
small constructions from Boost shortens development time and prevents 
having to reinvent many wheels.  Libraries that we use include 
__assign, __date_time, __enable_if, __file_system, __format, __function, __iterator, 
__multi_index, __operators, __optional, __pointer_cont, __signals, __smart, 
__thread, and __variant.
