<dt>August 17, 2007 -- Time Series Accepted.</dt>
<dd>Announcement: <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.boost.org/boost-announce/2007/08/0142.php">http://lists.boost.org/boost-announce/2007/08/0142.php</a></dd>
<dt>July 24, 2007 -- Boost Version 1.34.1 Released.</dt>
<dd>This is a bug fix release addressing many problems with the 1.34.0 release.
Announcement: <a class="reference external" href="http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=Boost+1.34.1">http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=Boost+1.34.1</a></dd>

<p>We need experienced review managers.  Please take a look at the list
of libraries in need of managers and check out their descriptions.  In
general review managers are active boost participants or library
contributors.  If you can serve as review manager for any of them,
email Ron Garcia or John Phillips, &quot;garcia at cs dot indiana dot edu&quot;
and &quot;jphillip at capital dot edu&quot; respectively.</p>
<p>A link to this report will be posted to www.boost.org.
If you would like us to make any modifications or additions to this
report before we do that, please email Ron or John.</p>
<p>If you're library author and plan on submitting a library for review
in the next 3-6 months, send Ron or John a short description of your
library and we'll add it to the Libraries Under Construction below.
We know that there are many libraries that are near completion, but we
have hard time keeping track all of them. Please keep us informed
about your progress.</p>

exception classes from having to consider what data needs to be
stored in exception objects in order for the catch site to be
able to make sense of what went wrong.</p>
<p class="last">When the exception class is used, arbitrary values can be stored
in any exception. This can be done directly in the
throw-expression, or at a later time as the exception object
propagates up the call stack. The ability to add data to any
exception object after it has been thrown is important, because
often some of the information needed to handle an exception is
unavailable at the time of the throw.</p>

Finite State Machine) programming concept. The main goals of the

<li>Simplicity. It should be very simple to create state machines using
this library.</li>
<li>Performance. The state machine infrastructure should not be
very time and memory-consuming in order to be applicable in
more use cases.</li>
<li>Extensibility. A developer may want to add more states to an
existing state machine.  A developer should also be able to
specify additional transitions and events for the machine with
minimum modifications to the existing code.</li>

from 1970ish). It works for undirected graphs too, but reports cycles
twice (one for each direction).</li>
<li>An algorithm for visiting all the cliques a graph (Bron&amp;Kerbosch).
Works for both directed and undirected.</li>

girth and circumference (from Tiernan), and clique number (from
Bron&amp;Kerbosch).</li>

with exterior properties.</li>
<li>runtime and compile-time tests for the new algorithms.</li>
<li>a substantial amount of documentation</li>
<li>Graph cores, implemented by David Gleich (&#64;Stanford University)</li>
<li>Deterministic graph generators - capable of creating or inducing
specific types of graphs over a vertex set (e.g., star graph, wheel
graph, prism graph, etc). There are several other specific types that
could be added to this, but I haven't had the time just yet.</li>

Boost.Iostreams).  As soon as I'm pretty sure that things are going

useful for creating constrained objects. The simplest example
of a constrained object is hour. The only valid values for an hour
within a day are integers from the range [0, 23]. With this library,
you can create a variable which behaves exactly like int, but does
not allow for assignment of values which do not belong to the
allowed range. The library doesn't focus only on constrained
objects that hold a value belonging to a specified range (i.e.,
bounded objects). Virtually any constraint can be imposed using
appropriate predicate. You can specify what happens in case of
assignment of an invalid value, e.g. an exception may be thrown or
the value may be adjusted to meet the constraint criterions.</td>
