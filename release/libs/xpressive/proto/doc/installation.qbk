[section Installing Proto]

[heading Getting Proto]

Currently the only way to get Proto is through CVS via the boost project on
SourceForge.net. Just go to [@http://sf.net/projects/boost] and follow the
instructions there for anonymous CVS access.

[heading Building with Proto]

Proto is a header-only template library, which means you don't need to alter
your build scripts or link to any separate lib file to use it. All you need
to do is `#include <boost/xpressive/proto/proto.hpp>`. This will include the
core of Proto. If you want to use any transforms, you must include the
appropriate header from the [^boost\/xpressive\/proto\/transform\/] directory.

[heading Requirements]

Proto depends on Boost. You must use the version in CVS HEAD.

[heading Supported Compilers]

Currently, Boost.Proto is known to work on the following compilers:

* Visual C++ 7.1 and higher
* GNU C++ 3.2 and higher
* Intel on Linun 8.1 and higher
* Intel on Windows 9.1 and higher
