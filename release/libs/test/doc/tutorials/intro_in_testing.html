  <H1>Introduction into testing</H1>
  <P class="first-line-indented">For almost everyone, the first introduction
    to the craft of programming is a version of the simple &quot;Hello World&quot; program.
    In C++, this first example might be written as</P>
  <PRE class="code">#<SPAN class="reserv-word">include</SPAN> &lt;<SPAN class="literal">ostream</SPAN>&gt; 

<SPAN class="cpp-type">int</SPAN> main()
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; <SPAN class="literal">&quot;Hello World\n&quot;</SPAN>;
}
</PRE>
  <P>This is a good introduction for several reasons. One is that the program
    is short enough, and the logic of its execution simple enough that direct
    inspection can show whether it is correct in all use cases known to the new
    student programmer. If this were the complexity of all programming, there
    would be no need to test anything before using it. In programming as a new
    student experiences it, testing is pointless and adds unneeded complexity.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">However, no actual programs are as simple as
    an introductory lesson makes &quot;Hello World&quot; seem. Not even &quot;Hello
    World&quot;. In
    all real programs, there are decisions to be made and multiple paths of execution
    based on these decisions. These decisions could be based on user input, streaming
    data, resource availability and dozens of other factors. The programmer strives
    to control the inputs, and results of these decisions, but no one can keep
    all of them clearly in mind once the size of the project exceeds just a few
    hundred lines. Even &quot;Hello World&quot; hides complexities of this sort in
    the simple seeming call to std::cout.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">Since the individual programmer can no longer
    determine the correctness of the program, there is a need for a different
    approach. An obvious possibility is testing the program after construction.
    Someone develops a set of test cases, where inputs are given to the program
    such that the behavior and outputs of a correctly performing program are
    known. The performance of the new program is compared to known standards
    and the new program either passes or fails. If it fails, attempts are made
    to fix it. If the test cases are carefully chosen, the specifics of the failure
    give an indication of what in the program needs to be fixed.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">This is an improvement over just not knowing
    whether the program is working properly, but it isn't a big improvement.
    If the whole program is tested at once, it is nearly impossible to develop
    test cases that clearly indicate what the failure is. The system is too complex,
    and the programmer still needs to understand almost all of the possible outcomes
    to be able to develop tests. As always, when a problem is too big and complicated
    a good idea is to try splitting it into smaller and simpler pieces.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">This approach leads to a layered system of testing,
    that is similar to the layered approach to original development and should
    be integrated into it. When writing a program, the design is factored into
    small units that are conceptually and structurally easier to grasp. A standard
    rule for this is that one unit performs one job or embodies one concept.
    These simple units are composed into larger and more complicated algorithms
    by passing needed information into a unit and receiving the desired result
    out of it. The units are integrated to perform the whole task. Testing should
    reflect this structure of development.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">The simplest layer is Unit Testing. A unit is
    the smallest conceptually whole segment of the program. Examples of basic
    units might be a single class or a single function. For each unit, the tester
    (who may or may not be the programmer) attempts to determine what states
    the unit can encounter while executing as part of the program. These states
    include determining the range of appropriate inputs to the unit, determining
    the range of possible inappropriate inputs, and recognizing any ways the
    state of the rest of the program might affect execution in this unit.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">With so many general statements, an example
    will help clarify. Imagine the following procedural function is part of a
    program, and the programmer wants to test it. For the sake of brevity, header
    includes and namespace qualifiers have been suppressed. </P>
  <PRE class="code"><SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN> find_root( <SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN>             (*f)(<SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN>), 
                  <SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN>               low_guess, 
                  <SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN>               high_guess, 
                  std::<SPAN class="cpp-type">vector</SPAN>&lt;<SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN>&gt;&amp; steps, 
                  <SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN>               tolerance )
{
    <SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN> solution;
    <SPAN class="cpp-type">bool  </SPAN> converged = <SPAN class="literal">false</SPAN>;

    <SPAN class="reserv-word">while</SPAN>(not converged)
    {
        <SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN> temp = (low_guess + high_guess) / <SPAN class="literal">2.0</SPAN>;
        steps.push_back( temp );

        <SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN> f_temp = f(temp);
        <SPAN class="cpp-type">double</SPAN> f_low = f(low_guess);
        
        <SPAN class="reserv-word">if</SPAN>(abs(f_temp) &lt; tolerance)
        {
            solution  = temp;
            converged = true;
        }
        <SPAN class="reserv-word">else </SPAN><SPAN class="reserv-word">if</SPAN>(f_temp / abs(f_temp) == f_low / abs(f_low))
        {
            low_guess = temp;
            converged = false;
        }
        <SPAN class="reserv-word">else</SPAN>
        {
            high_guess = temp;
            converged = false;
        }
    }
    
    <SPAN class="reserv-word">return</SPAN> solution;
}
</PRE>
  <P class="first-line-indented">This code, although brief and simple is getting
    long enough that it takes attention to find what is done and why. It is no
    longer obvious at a glance what the intent of the program is, so careful
    naming must be used to carry that intent.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">Thanks to the control structures, there are
    some obvious execution paths in the code. However, there are also a few less
    obvious paths. For example, if the root finder takes many steps to converge
    to an acceptable answer, the vector that is holding the history of steps
    taken may need to reallocate for additional space. In this case, there are
    many hidden steps in the single push_back command. These steps also include
    the chance of failure, since that is always a possibility in a memory allocation. </P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">A second example notes that the value of the
    function at the low guess has not been tested, so there is the chance of
    a zero division. Also, if the value of the function at the high guess is
    zero, the root finder will miss that root entirely. It may even fall into
    an infinite loop if no root lies between the low and high values.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">In this unit, proper testing includes checking
    the behavior in each possibility. It also includes checking the function
    by giving inputs where the correct answer is known and checking the results
    against that answer. Thus, the unit is tested in every execution path to
    assure proper behavior.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">Test cases are chosen to expose as many errors
    as possible. A defining characteristic of a good test case is that the programmer
    knows what the unit should do if it is functioning properly. Test cases should
    be generated to exercise each available execution path. For the above snippet,
    this includes the obvious and the not so obvious paths. Every path should
    be tested, since every path is a possible outcome of program execution.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">Thus, to write a good testing suite, the tester
    must know the structure of the code. The most dependable way to accomplish
    this is if the original programmer writes tests as part of creating the code.
    In fact, it is advisable that the tests are produced before the code is written,
    and updated whenever structure decisions are changed. This way, the tests
    are written with a view toward how the unit should perform instead of reproducing
    the programmer's thinking from writing the code. While black box testing
    is also useful, it is important that someone who knows the design decisions
    made and the rationale for those decisions test the code unit. A programmer
    who can't devise good tests for a unit does not yet know the problem at hand
    well enough to program dependably.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">When a unit is completed and tested, it is ready
    for integration with other units in the program. This is integration should
    also be tested. At this point, the test cases focus on the interaction between
    the units. Tests are designed to exercise each way the units can affect each
    other.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">This is the point in development where proper
    unit testing really shines. If each unit is doing what it should be doing
    and not creating unexpected side effects, any issues in testing a set of
    integrated units must come from how they are passing information. Thus, the
    nearly intractable problem of finding an error while many units interact
    becomes the less intimidating problem of finding the breakdown in communications.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">At each layer of increasing complexity, new
    tests are run, and if the prior tests of the components are well designed
    and all issues are fixed, new errors are isolated to the integration. This
    process continues, in parallel with development, from the smallest units
    to the completed program.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">This shows that there is a need to be able to
    check and test code snippets such as individual functions and classes independent
    of the program of which they will become a part. That is, the need for a
    means to provide predetermined inputs to the unit and to check the outputs
    against expected results. Such a system must allow for both normal operation
    and error conditions, and allow the programmer to produce a thorough description
    of the results.</P>
  <P class="first-line-indented">This is the goal and rationale for all unit
    testing, and supporting testing of this sort is the purpose of the Boost.Test
    library. As is shown below, Boost.Test provides a well-integrated set of
    tools to support this testing effort throughout the programming and maintenance
    cycles of software development.</P>
