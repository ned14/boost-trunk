- Interface for building/running tests on a per-project basis.  There
  are CMake bugs and Brad King recommends using "test driver"
  binaries.  Can of worms.  

- Check to see how the tests look under XCode/VS.  Brad king indicates
  that the one-binary-per-test setup is wrong. 

- Try to figure out what is happening with "empty" .o files in Mac build

- In libs/numeric/interval/test, how to detect OSF and HP's C++ compiler?

- In libs/parameter/test, fix the test that depends on Python

- Spirit library: multi-threaded tests. There must be an easy way to
  handle this... support variants in testing? (I think we need
  "boost_add_executable" to handle these...)

- Statechart library: deal with building libraries for testing, and
  with link-only tests.

- Xpressive: port multipledefs and msvc-stlport tests

- Program options: DLL tests need to force linking against the static
  boost_test_exec_monitor (since no others exist), even when linking
  against the shared boost_program_options. Ugh.
