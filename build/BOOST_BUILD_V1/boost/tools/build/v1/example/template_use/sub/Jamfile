# Example of how to use a template target declared in another project.
# This is for Boost.Build-V1

subproject tools/build/examples/template_use/sub ;

# Declare a library target. This 'inherits' the attributes of
# the template which in this case adds the needed include
# directory. Because templates are "special" targets they
# appear in the source dependencies section and must be
# a relative reference to the template target in it's declared
# location.

lib simple
    :
        # SOURCES
        <template>../t-common
        simple_lib.cpp
    :
        # REQUIREMENTS
    :
        # DEFAULT BUILDS
        debug <threading>single/multi
    ;

# Declare an executable target that also uses the template,
# and the above library target.
