  <p>Aleksey Gurtovoy is a Russian guy from Siberia, who now lives and works
  in the United States. He is a technical lead at <a href=
  "http://www.meta-comm.com">MetaCommunications</a>, a job and people which
  have taught him so much.</p>

  <p>He was born in early 1977, has been in love with computers since 1989,
  and still has a lot of exciting ideas for his "spare time" in the next few
  years. He graduated with honors from Krasnoyarsk Technical State University
  in 1998 with a Master Degree in Computer Science.</p>

  <p>While being acknowledged as a talented programmer, Aleksey tries to be a
  better engineer than he is now and hopes that reading good books will help
  him with that task. He reads a lot. One of his favorite books about his
  profession is 'The Mythical Man-Month' by Frederic P. Brooks, Jr.</p>

  <p>Aleksey has been working with C++ since 1993, he loves the language, and
  is involved in its progress. Sometimes you can come across his articles in
  the <a href="news:comp.lang.c++.moderated">comp.lang.c++.moderated</a> and
  <a href="news:comp.std.c++">comp.std.c++</a> <a>newsgroups. The other
  numerous things Aleksey is interested in include patterns, programming
  languages, organization of software development process, and tools &amp;
  technologies which make programmer's life easier (e.g. compilers).</a></p>

  <p>He is not married, but he has in mind one great girl he hopes to be with
  someday.</p>
