[section:syntax Syntax Summary]

A simple quickbook document might look something like:

[pre'''
    [book A sweet little horror story
        [quickbook 1.5]
        [author Brown, Fredric]
    ]
    
    The last man on Earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on
    the door...
''']

The document starts with the
[link quickbook.syntax.docinfo document info block].
This describes the type of the document, it's title and document
metadata. In this case just the version of quickbook to be used.

This is then followed by one or more blocks. An example of
a block is the paragraph or a C++ code snippet. In this example we just
have a single paragraph. Some blocks have
special mark-ups. Blocks, except code snippets which have their own
grammar (C++ or Python), are composed of one or more phrases. A phrase
can be a simple contiguous run of characters. Phrases can have special
mark-ups. Marked up phrases can recursively contain other phrases, but
cannot contain blocks. A terminal is a self contained block-level or
phrase-level element that does not nest anything.

Blocks, in general, are delimited by two end-of-lines (the block terminator).
Phrases in each block cannot contain a block terminator. This way, syntax errors
such as un-matched closing brackets do not go haywire and corrupt anything past
a single block.

[section:docinfo Document Info]

Every document must begin with a Document Info section, which looks something
like this:

[pre'''
[article The Document Title
    [quickbook 1.5]
    [version 1.0]
    [id the_document_name]
    [copyright 2000 2002 2003 Joe Blow, Jane Doe]
    [authors [Blow, Joe] [Doe, Jane]]
    [license The document's license]
    [source-mode source-type]
]
''']

`article` is the document type. There are several possible document types,
most of these are based on docbook document elements. These are fully
described in
[@http://www.docbook.org/tdg/ DocBook: The Definitive Guide]:

* [@http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/book.html book]
* [@http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/article.html article]
* [@http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/chapter.html chapter]
* [@http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/part.html part]
* [@http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/appendix.html appendix]
* [@http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/preface.html preface]
* [@http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/qandadiv.html qandadiv]

Boostbook also adds another document type [^[link boostbook.defining library]]
for documenting software libraries.

So the documentation for the 'foo' library might start:

[pre'''
[library Foo
    [quickbook 1.5]
    [version 1.0]
    [id foo]
]
''']

[section:attributes Document Info Attributes]

quickbook 1.5 declares the version of quickbook the document is written for.
In its absence, version 1.1 is assumed.

=version=, =id=, =dirname=, =copyright=, =purpose=, =category=, =authors=,
=license=, =last-revision= and =source-mode= are optional information.

=dirname=, =purpose= and =category= are boostbook attributes which are only
valid for =library= documents. If you use them for other document types,
quickbook will warn about them, but still use them, generating invalid markup,
that's just ignored by the style sheets.

=source-type= is a lowercase string setting the initial __source_mode__. If
the =source-mode= field is omitted, a default value of =c++= will be used.

[endsect] [/attributes]

[endsect] [/docinfo]

[section Section]

Starting a new section is accomplished with:

[pre'''
[section:id The Section Title]
''']

where /id/ is optional. id will be the filename of the generated section.
If it is not present, "The Section Title" will be normalized and become the id.
Valid characters are =a-Z=, =A-Z=, =0-9= and =_=. All non-valid characters are
converted to underscore and all upper-case are converted to lower case.
Thus: "The Section Title" will be normalized to "the_section_title".

End a section with:

[pre'''
[endsect]
''']

Sections can nest, and that results in a hierarchy in the table of contents.

[endsect] [/Section]

[section Comments]

Can be placed anywhere.

[pre
'''[/ comment (no output generated) ]'''
]

[/ for testing only... ]

[pre
'''[/ comments can be nested [/ some more here] ]'''
]

[/ for testing [/ only ] ]

[pre
'''[/ Quickbook blocks can nest inside comments. [*Comment this out too!] ]'''
]

[/ for testing [*only ] ]

[endsect] [/Comments]

[endsect] [/Syntax Summary]
