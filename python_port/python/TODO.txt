- Document that using strings for classes will not be carried over.

- Review absolutely all 'raise' statements and decide what do do
about them.

- Test dependency properties. Probably need to fix them!

- Review logging in target.py


2. The current way to make rules available to Jamfiles is nasty --
only functions defined in ProjectContext class are exported.

3. boost.build.engine.engine.Engine is nasty -- any
better Python solution?

4. The error messages, so far, are truly terrible -- if Python
code throws does something wrong we get lots of backtrace.

5. Can one have nested classes in Python.

-> 6. Need to consider how to reimplement the 'errors' modules.

-> 7. Pass bjam's argv to Python

8. For some reason, if Python exports a function taking no
arguments to bjam, and bjam calls it with no arguments, bjam
passes 1 argument (empty list).

9. What to do about 'using' and 'import'?

10. In the make example, the action is called fine but
the associated procedural code is not executed.

11. Test the 'use-project' rule, 'build-project' too.

12. Add the tools python directory to path searched
by 'using'/'import'.


Sanity checks:
--------------

- Review all FIXME in code
- Remove all porting state comments at the top of files.
- Update copyrights, add Pedro to copyrights.


Post-port
---------

- Use 'Metetarget' for classes in the 'targets' module.

- The 'exact' parameter to FileTarget should be passed using
keyword arguments.

- Keep all information pertaining to a project inside project
target. Kill ProjectAttributes class.

- Should use bit flags for feature attributes

- Should add Property class, and kill string manipulation.

- Merge VirtualTarget with AbstractFileTarget?

- In VirtualTarget, split methods that both take and return
value into set/get pairs.

- Use metatarget/base class to automatically register virtual
targets or just never create duplicate ones?
