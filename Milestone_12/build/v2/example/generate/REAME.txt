This example shows the 'generate' rule, that
allows you to construct target using any arbitrary
set of transformation and commands.

The rule is similar to 'make' and 'notfile', but
unlike those, you can operate in terms of
Boost.Build 'virtual targets', which is more
flexible.

Please consult the docs for more explanations.
