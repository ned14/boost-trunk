1960s in childish pursuits, he spent the 1970s at school becoming ever more fascinated with the mysteries of physics.  This he went on to study at St
John's College, Cambridge until 1985, at which time he entered the world of employment.</p>
<p>After early work with other languages, he became involved with C++ in the early 1990s and now works as consultant, not far from his original home, in
Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>He enjoys playing the piano, walking in the local countryside, playing 5-a-side (indoor soccer), and sailing.</p>
